## Arc.dev vs. Toptal: Key Differences

Understanding the positioning difference helps you tailor your approach:

| Aspect | Arc.dev | Toptal |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Screening rigor | Moderate (portfolio + interview) | High (multi-stage, ~3% acceptance) |
| Client type | Startups to mid-market | Enterprise and funded startups |
| Rate range | $80-150/hr | $100-200/hr |
| Engagement type | Often longer-term embedded roles | Project-based or fractional |
| Matching | Proactive matchers + self-serve | Matcher-driven |
| Commission | Platform takes a margin | Platform takes a margin |
| Speed to first gig | Faster (less screening) | Slower (more screening) |

**Strategy:** Apply to both. Arc.dev is your faster on-ramp to premium clients. Toptal is the prestige play that takes longer but commands higher rates.

## Common Gotchas

1. **Neglecting GitHub** -- Arc.dev pulls from your GitHub profile. If your public repos are empty, outdated, or messy, it weakens your application. Pin 4-6 of your best repositories. Add README files to each. Make sure recent commit activity is visible.

2. **Generic technology list** -- Listing 30 technologies with no depth looks worse than listing 10 with demonstrated expertise. Prioritize the technologies you can discuss in depth during an interview. For your positioning, lead with: TypeScript, Next.js, n8n, Claude/OpenAI APIs, Supabase, PostgreSQL.

3. **Underpricing** -- Arc.dev serves clients who are willing to pay for quality. Starting at $60/hr signals junior-level work. $100-125/hr is appropriate for your experience level. You can always negotiate up on specific engagements.

4. **Slow response to matchers** -- Arc.dev matchers are your pipeline. If you consistently take 3+ days to respond, they'll stop sending opportunities. Treat matcher messages like client inquiries -- same-day response.

5. **Vague portfolio descriptions** -- "Built a web app for a client" tells the matcher nothing. Use the Problem > Solution > Result format with specific technologies and measurable outcomes. "Architected a Next.js + Supabase client portal that reduced manual reporting time by 70% for a 50-person consulting firm" gives them something to match against.

6. **Not specifying AI/automation** -- Arc.dev is heavily tech-focused. Your differentiator is the AI + automation combination, which is in high demand. Make sure "AI" and "automation" appear prominently in your headline, summary, and skills. Don't bury your best positioning.

7. **Ignoring the opportunities board** -- Don't wait passively for matchers. Browse Arc.dev's posted opportunities weekly and apply to relevant ones directly. The combination of proactive applications and matcher introductions maximizes your pipeline.

8. **Availability confusion** -- If you set "full-time" availability but can only do 20 hours per week, you'll get matched with roles you can't take and waste everyone's time. Be precise about your hours, timezone, and start date.

9. **Forgetting to update tracker** -- Log your application date, each screening stage, and approval status in `tracker.md`. When you're managing applications across Toptal, Arc.dev, Upwork, and Fiverr simultaneously, the tracker is the only way to stay organized.

10. **Not cross-referencing with Toptal** -- If you're applying to both platforms (recommended), keep your positioning consistent but slightly differentiated. Arc.dev leans startup/mid-market, so emphasize speed and modern stack. Toptal leans enterprise, so emphasize scale and leadership. Same person, different emphasis.
