# PrettyFly Gig Deployment Engine — Context

> Generated by Jr Dev Agentic Workflow (Phase 1: Discover)
> PIVOT: Replaced full SaaS app approach with lightweight Strategy Engine + Content Factory.

## Problem Statement

Alex has zero active listings across gig platforms despite having complete strategy, pricing, and copy drafts ready. Every day without listings is lost revenue against a 90-day $25K/month target. The bottleneck is strategy-to-deployment velocity, not tooling.

## Target Users

Alex Hale, Founder of PrettyFly.ai. Solo operator managing freelance operations across Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, and Arc.dev. Daily workflow: morning proposal session (7:00-7:45 AM), delivery work, evening analytics review.

## What Already Exists

The original Gig-Engine project (`/Users/alexhale/Projects/Gig-Engine/`) has a scaffolded Next.js 14 app with 88 source files, 14 SQL migrations, 13 routes, 25 components, and 5 hooks. However, this is overbuilt for the current need. Zero listings are deployed. The app has no data to manage.

### Existing Assets (HIGH VALUE — reuse these)

| Asset | Location | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 10 priority gig definitions with 3-tier pricing | `docs/GIG-COPY.md` | Draft copy, needs platform-specific formatting |
| 7 proposal templates (Upwork) | `docs/PROPOSAL-TEMPLATES.md` | Ready to use |
| Platform optimization guides | `docs/PLATFORM-GUIDES.md` | Strategy complete for Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, Arc.dev |
| 90-day revenue strategy | `docs/STRATEGY.md` | Revenue targets, phasing, channel mix |
| 5 service pillar definitions with colors | `src/data/seed-pillars.ts` | Defined: Automation, AI, Architecture, Web Dev, Strategy |
| 8 platform profiles | `src/data/seed-platforms.ts` | Defined with status and URLs |
| 10 seed gig listings | `src/data/seed-gigs.ts` | Full pricing tiers in TypeScript |

### What We're NOT Building

- Full SaaS application (25-session build plan)
- Kanban boards, drag-and-drop pipeline
- Revenue analytics dashboards with Recharts
- Supabase database with 14 migrations
- Auth flow, middleware, API routes
- Project delivery tracking, time tracking

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Architecture | Document-driven + Claude Code agents | Zero build time, immediate deployment |
| Content generation | Claude Code agent/skill | Generates platform-ready copy from strategy matrix |
| Tracking | Markdown tracker | Simple, no database needed, git-versioned |
| Platform posting | Manual with checklists | Each platform has unique UI; automation is a Phase 2 optimization |
| Proposal workflow | Existing templates + AI customization | 7 templates already written, just need per-job customization |
| When to build the app | After 20+ listings deployed and generating data | Build the management tool when there's something to manage |

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] Strategy matrix mapping all services x platforms with pricing
- [ ] Content generator agent that produces platform-ready listing copy
- [ ] Platform-specific formatting templates (Fiverr format != Upwork format)
- [ ] Deployment checklists per platform
- [ ] Simple listing tracker (what's live, when posted, performance)
- [ ] Morning proposal workflow (template + job description → custom proposal)

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: 90 days to $25K/month — every day of building tools instead of deploying listings costs money
- **Platforms**: Fiverr (productized gigs), Upwork (proposals/fixed), Toptal (hourly/enterprise), Arc.dev (hourly)
- **Single operator**: Alex does everything — system must minimize context switching
- **Existing content**: Leverage the 10 gig drafts, 7 templates, and platform guides already written

## Research Findings

### Multi-Agent Orchestration (from research-stack)

Jason Hoffman shipped 309K LOC in 27 days using 6-15 parallel Claude Code agents with strict role isolation. Key insight: encode rules in documentation, not enforcement code. Documentation-as-governance is the pattern that scales.

### Vertical Agent Stacks

The most effective agent systems are task-focused and role-aware — understanding the tools, language, and workflows of a specific domain. A "gig deployment agent" that understands Fiverr's algorithm factors and Upwork's proposal strategy is more valuable than a generic coding agent.

### Speed Over Features

The research consistently shows: get to market fast, iterate with real data. Building comprehensive tooling before having customers is the classic premature optimization trap.
