# Phase 1: Discover — COMPLETE

## Summary

Pivoted from full SaaS application to Strategy Engine + Content Factory approach after brainstorming session. Core insight: Alex has zero listings deployed, and every day building a management app is a day not generating revenue. The strategy, pricing, and copy drafts already exist in docs/.

## Key Findings

- Bottleneck is strategy decisions, not manual posting
- 10 priority gigs already defined with 3-tier pricing
- 7 proposal templates ready to use
- Platform guides complete for all 4 targets
- Original 25-session SaaS app is premature — build it when there's data to manage

## Completed

- [x] Problem statement defined
- [x] Existing assets audited
- [x] Approach decided (Approach A: Strategy + Content)
- [x] Context document written
