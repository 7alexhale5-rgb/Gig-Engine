# PrettyFly Gig Deployment Engine — Build Plan

> Generated by Jr Dev Agentic Workflow (Phase 2: Design)
> PIVOT: Content factory, not web app. Build time measured in hours, not weeks.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Description | Key Deliverables | Est. Time |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 3a: Foundation | Strategy matrix, file structure, agent definitions | Matrix, agents, checklists | 1-2 hours |
| 3b: Content Generation | Generate all listing content for P1 gigs | 10+ platform-ready listings | 2-3 hours |
| 3c: Deployment Prep | Checklists, tracker, image templates | Ready-to-post package | 1 hour |
| 4: Validate | Review all generated content for quality | Reviewed, edited content | 1 hour |
| 5: Ship | Alex deploys listings to platforms | Live listings, populated tracker | Manual (ongoing) |

**Total build time: ~6 hours** (vs 25 sessions / 6-8 weeks for the original app)

## Phase 3a: Foundation

### 1. Create Strategy Matrix

Expand `docs/GIG-COPY.md` (10 gigs) into a full strategy matrix:

**File**: `strategy-matrix.md` (project root)

Populate from existing data:
- 10 priority gigs from GIG-COPY.md (P1)
- Expand each pillar to 4-6 services (P2/P3)
- Cross-reference with PLATFORM-GUIDES.md for platform fit
- Add keywords column using platform optimization guides

Target: 25-30 rows covering all 5 pillars.

### 2. Create Agent Definitions

**File**: `~/.claude/agents/gig-generator.md`

Agent that reads a strategy matrix row and generates platform-specific listing content. Must understand:
- Fiverr gig format (title, tiers, description, tags, FAQ)
- Upwork profile/proposal format
- The GIG-COPY.md formula (hook, deliverables, why me, process, FAQ, CTA)
- Pillar-specific language and positioning

**File**: `~/.claude/agents/proposal-generator.md`

Agent that takes a job posting + template and generates a custom proposal. Enhances the existing 7 templates in PROPOSAL-TEMPLATES.md.

### 3. Create File Structure

- [ ] All 4 platform checklists written

## Phase 3b: Content Generation

### Batch 1: P1 Gigs (10 listings)

Generate platform-ready content for all 10 priority gigs from GIG-COPY.md.

For each gig, based on its platform assignment:

**Fiverr listings to generate:**
1. GIG-001: GoHighLevel Setup & Automation ($197/$497/$997)
2. GIG-002: n8n/Make Workflow Build ($97/$297/$797)
3. GIG-003: AI Chatbot Implementation ($197/$497/$1,297)
4. GIG-005: Custom Dashboard Build ($297/$697/$1,297)
5. GIG-006: Landing Page ($147/$347/$697)
6. GIG-008: API Integration ($147/$397/$797)

**Upwork listings to generate:**
1. GIG-001: GoHighLevel Setup & Automation (fixed $500-2K)
2. GIG-002: n8n/Make Workflow Build (fixed $300-1.5K)
3. GIG-004: CRM Migration & Setup (fixed $500-3K)
4. GIG-005: Custom Dashboard Build (fixed $500-2.5K)
5. GIG-007: Business Process Automation Audit (fixed $300-2K)
6. GIG-008: API Integration (fixed $300-1.5K)
7. GIG-009: AI Lead Qualification System (fixed $500-3K)
8. GIG-010: Client Portal MVP (fixed $1K-5K)

**Total P1 content pieces: 14 listings** (6 Fiverr + 8 Upwork)

### Generation Workflow

For each listing, the gig-generator agent produces:
1. Read the strategy matrix row
2. Read the platform-specific guide from PLATFORM-GUIDES.md
3. Read the gig copy formula from GIG-COPY.md
4. Generate platform-formatted content
5. Write to `listings/{platform}/GIG-{id}-{slug}.md`

### Batch 2: P2 Expansion (if time permits)

Expand each pillar with 2-3 additional service variations. Example:
- Automation pillar: Add "Zapier Workflow Cleanup" and "Email Automation Sequence" gigs
- AI pillar: Add "RAG Knowledge Base Setup" and "AI Content Generation Pipeline" gigs

### Acceptance Criteria (3b)

- [ ] 6 Fiverr listing files generated with full copy
- [ ] 8 Upwork listing files generated with full copy
- [ ] Each listing follows the platform-specific format
- [ ] Pricing matches strategy matrix
- [ ] Keywords included for platform SEO
- [ ] FAQ section on every Fiverr listing (5 questions)

## Phase 3c: Deployment Prep

### 1. Platform Checklists

Write step-by-step posting guides for each platform, referencing the generated content files. Include:
- Exact click paths in platform UI
- Where to paste each section of generated content
- Image/gallery requirements and specs
- Settings to configure (delivery time, revision count)
- Common gotchas per platform

### 2. Tracker Setup

Initialize `tracker.md` with all P1 listings in "generated" status, ready for Alex to update as he posts.

### 3. Morning Workflow Protocol

Document the daily proposal workflow:
1. Open Upwork at 7:00 AM
2. Search for jobs matching service pillars
3. Run proposal-generator agent with job posting
4. Customize output, submit
5. Repeat 5-10 times
6. Update tracker with any new opportunities

### Acceptance Criteria (3c)

- [ ] 4 platform checklists written (Fiverr, Upwork, Toptal, Arc.dev)
- [ ] Tracker initialized with all P1 listings
- [ ] Morning workflow protocol documented
- [ ] All generated content reviewed for copy quality

## Phase 4: Validate

### Content Review

Use parallel review team (3 agents):

1. **Copy Quality Reviewer** — Check every listing for:
   - Compelling hook (first 2 sentences)
   - Clear value proposition
   - Correct pricing alignment with strategy
   - No typos or grammatical errors
   - Platform-appropriate tone (Fiverr = approachable, Upwork = professional)
   - Keywords present for platform search

2. **Strategy Reviewer** — Check overall portfolio for:
   - All 5 pillars represented
   - Pricing tiers make sense (no cannibalization between platforms)
   - Competitive positioning clear
   - No service overlap/confusion
   - Platform fit (right services on right platforms)

3. **Completeness Checker** — Verify:
   - All P1 gigs have content for assigned platforms
   - Fiverr listings have all required sections (title, tiers, description, tags, FAQ)
   - Upwork listings have profile sections + sample proposals
   - Checklists are actionable
   - Tracker is populated

### Fix Issues

- Content quality issues: Regenerate with improved prompts
- Strategy issues: Adjust matrix and regenerate affected listings
- Completeness issues: Generate missing content

### Acceptance Criteria (4)

- [ ] All 14 P1 listings reviewed by all 3 reviewers
- [ ] All issues logged in errors.md
- [ ] MEDIUM/LOW issues auto-fixed
- [ ] No CRITICAL/HIGH issues remaining
- [ ] Final content package ready for deployment

## Phase 5: Ship (Manual Deployment)

Unlike a typical Jr Dev pipeline, "ship" here means Alex manually posts listings to platforms. The system's job is to make this as fast as possible.

### 5a. Fiverr Sprint (Day 1-2)

Alex posts all 6 Fiverr gigs:
1. Open `listings/fiverr/GIG-001-*.md`
2. Follow `checklists/fiverr-posting-checklist.md`
3. Post listing
4. Update `tracker.md` with URL and date
5. Repeat for all 6 gigs

### 5b. Upwork Sprint (Day 2-3)

Alex updates Upwork profile and activates for proposals:
1. Create/update Specialized Profiles per generated content
2. Set up saved searches for each service pillar
3. Start daily proposal cadence using proposal-generator agent
4. Update `tracker.md`

### 5c. Premium Platform Applications (Day 3-7)

Apply to Toptal and Arc.dev:
1. Follow `checklists/toptal-application-checklist.md`
2. Follow `checklists/arc-application-checklist.md`
3. These have multi-week onboarding — start early

### 5d. Mike Monitoring Setup

Configure Mike to:
- Check `tracker.md` daily via heartbeat
- Remind Alex of morning proposal cadence
- Alert when 7 days pass without a new listing posted
- Prompt for performance metric updates weekly

### Acceptance Criteria (5)

- [ ] All 6 Fiverr gigs live
- [ ] Upwork profile updated with 2-3 specialized profiles
- [ ] Daily proposal cadence started (5-10/day)
- [ ] Toptal application submitted
- [ ] Arc.dev application submitted
- [ ] Tracker showing all live listings with URLs
- [ ] Mike monitoring active

## Agent Routing

| Build Phase | Agent | Model | Rationale |
|-------------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 3a: Foundation | architect | opus | Strategy matrix design requires domain reasoning |
| 3b: Generation | gig-generator (parallel) | opus | Content quality is critical for conversion |
| 3c: Prep | implementer (self) | opus | Checklists and documentation |
| 4: Validate | 3-agent review team | opus | Parallel quality + strategy + completeness review |
| 5: Ship | Mike | opus (OpenClaw) | Monitoring and reminders |
