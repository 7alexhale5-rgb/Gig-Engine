## Gig Description

### Hook
Your business website is the first thing people check before they decide to call you, buy from you, or move on to a competitor. If it's slow, looks dated, or doesn't show up on Google — you're losing deals you'll never know about.

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Contact form with email notification
- On-page SEO (meta tags, headings, alt text, sitemap)
- Fast loading: optimized images, clean code, Lighthouse 90+
- Deployed to Vercel on your domain

**Standard ($597) — Business Site**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Up to 6 pages (e.g., Home, About, Services, Portfolio/Work, Blog, Contact)

- Google Analytics 4 setup with conversion tracking
- Form integration with your CRM or email marketing tool (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Mailchimp)
- Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- Structured data markup for enhanced Google results
- Cookie consent and privacy policy page

**Premium ($1,197) — Full Business Platform**

### Why Me
I don't use WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace. I build business websites with Next.js and deploy them to Vercel — which means they load faster, rank better, and cost less to host than anything a page builder can produce. You get a site that scores 90+ on Lighthouse, renders instantly, and you own the code outright. No monthly platform fees eating into your margin.

I'm the founder of PrettyFly.ai and a CTO with 10+ years in production web development. I've built everything from startup MVPs to enterprise platforms, and I bring that same engineering discipline to business websites. Your site won't just look professional — it'll be built like a product.

### My Process
1. **Content & structure:** I work with you to define the sitemap, page structure, and content hierarchy. You provide the copy and images (or I'll work with what you have and guide you on what's missing). We agree on the blueprint before design starts.
2. **Design & build:** I build the site page by page with a live staging link you can review. Mobile-first, fast-loading, SEO-optimized from the start. We iterate on the staging link until every page is right.
3. **Launch & optimize:** I connect your domain, set up analytics, submit your sitemap to Google Search Console, and run a final performance audit. You get a site that's live, indexed, and ready to bring in business.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Do I need to provide the content and images?**
   A: Ideally, yes — you know your business best. But I know that's often the hardest part. I can work with rough drafts, bullet points, or even just a conversation about your services. I'll structure the content for the web and tell you exactly what's missing.

2. **Q: Why Next.js instead of WordPress or Squarespace?**
   A: Speed, SEO, and cost. A Next.js site on Vercel loads in under 1 second, scores 90+ on Lighthouse, and hosts for free on Vercel's generous plan. WordPress needs plugins, security patches, and $20-50/month hosting. Squarespace charges $16-49/month and you don't own the code.

3. **Q: Can I update the content myself?**
   A: Standard and Premium include CMS integration so you can add blog posts, update text, and manage images without touching code. For Basic, I'll provide clear documentation on how to make simple content changes.

4. **Q: Will the site be found on Google?**
   A: Every tier includes on-page SEO fundamentals: proper heading structure, meta tags, image optimization, XML sitemap, and fast load times. Premium adds a full technical SEO audit and structured data markup. I also submit your site to Google Search Console so indexing starts immediately.

5. **Q: How much does hosting cost?**
   A: Vercel's free tier handles most business websites with zero monthly cost. If your site gets significant traffic (100K+ visits/month), Vercel Pro is $20/month. Either way, it's a fraction of what WordPress hosting or Squarespace subscriptions cost.
