## Gig Description

### Hook
Your business runs on multiple platforms that do not talk to each other -- and no off-the-shelf connector or Zapier integration can handle what you need. When you require custom code-level API work -- REST endpoints, GraphQL queries, OAuth flows, webhook listeners, complex multi-endpoint orchestration -- you need a developer who writes production integration code, not someone clicking through a visual builder.

### What You Get

**Basic ($77) — Simple Sync**
- One-way data sync between 2 systems (e.g., new Stripe payment creates HubSpot contact)
- REST API or webhook integration
- Field mapping and data transformation
- Basic testing and deployment
- Setup documentation

**Standard ($397) — Full Integration**
- Bi-directional sync between 2 systems (data flows both ways, stays in sync)
- OAuth authentication setup where required
- Error handling with automatic retries on failure
- Data validation and field mapping with transformation rules
- Comprehensive testing against real data
- Technical documentation with architecture diagram
- 7 days of post-delivery monitoring

**Premium ($797) — Multi-System Hub**
- Integration spanning 3-5 systems with a central data flow architecture
- Webhook endpoints for real-time event-driven sync
- Rate limiting, pagination handling, and batch processing for large datasets
- Monitoring dashboard to track sync health and error rates
- Alerting on failures (email or Slack)
- Full technical documentation with data flow diagrams
- 14 days of post-delivery support and tuning

### Why Me
I am the founder of PrettyFly.ai and a CTO who writes custom integration code at the API level -- REST, GraphQL, webhooks, OAuth 2.0, JWT, and custom endpoints. This is not a no-code platform gig; I build real coded integrations that handle edge cases no visual builder can touch: complex authentication flows, multi-endpoint orchestration, rate limiting, pagination, conflict resolution, and payload transformation. Every integration includes proper error handling, logging, and monitoring so you can trust it to run unattended.

### My Process
1. **Scope the integration:** We review the systems involved, the data that needs to flow between them, and any authentication requirements. I confirm API availability and identify the cleanest integration path.
2. **Build and test:** I build the integration with proper error handling, test it against real data in a staging environment, and iterate until every edge case is covered.
3. **Deploy and hand off:** I deploy to your environment, verify everything is syncing correctly, and provide documentation so your team understands exactly how the data flows.

### FAQ
1. **Q: What systems and APIs can you integrate?**
   A: Any system with a REST API, GraphQL API, or webhook support. Common examples: CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive), payment platforms (Stripe, Square, PayPal), e-commerce (Shopify, WooCommerce), project tools (Notion, Monday, Asana), email platforms (Mailchimp, SendGrid), databases (Supabase, Firebase, PostgreSQL), and custom APIs.

2. **Q: What if one of my systems does not have a public API?**
   A: Many systems that lack a documented public API still offer webhooks, CSV exports, or other integration points. Message me with the specific platforms and I will assess what is possible. In some cases, I can build a custom middleware layer to bridge the gap.

3. **Q: How do you handle authentication (OAuth, API keys, etc.)?**
   A: I set up whatever authentication the APIs require — OAuth 2.0 flows, API key management, JWT tokens, or basic auth. Credentials are stored securely and never hard-coded. I will guide you through any authorization steps that require account-owner approval.

4. **Q: Will the integration handle large volumes of data?**
   A: Yes. The Premium tier is specifically designed for high-volume scenarios with pagination handling, batch processing, and rate limit management. If you are syncing thousands of records, I will architect the integration to handle it without hitting API limits or timeouts.

5. **Q: What happens if something breaks after delivery?**
   A: Standard includes 7 days of monitoring and Premium includes 14 days. During that period, I fix any issues at no extra cost. Beyond that, the documentation I provide gives your team (or any developer) everything they need to maintain the integration.

### CTA
Have a tricky integration? Message me the systems you need connected and what data should flow between them -- I will scope it for free and recommend the right tier.

## Requirements
- Names of the systems/platforms you need connected
- Description of what data should flow between them (e.g., "when a new order is placed in Shopify, create a contact in HubSpot")
- API keys or admin access to the systems involved (or willingness to provide during kickoff)
- Any existing integrations or middleware already in place
- Volume expectations (how many records/events per day)
