## Gig Description

### Hook
Your clients are emailing you for status updates, downloading files from Google Drive links, and logging into three different tools to get what they need. A custom client portal puts everything behind one login — and makes your business look like it has a dedicated product team.

### What You Get

**Basic ($397) — Portal Foundation**
- User authentication system (email/password signup and login)
- Client dashboard with personalized data views
- Up to 3 data display pages (e.g., Projects, Documents, Messages)
- Mobile-responsive design that works on any device
- Secure session management and password reset flow
- Deployed to a live staging URL for review
- Source code handoff

**Standard ($1,297) — Full Portal**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Full CRUD functionality (clients can create, read, update, and delete their own records)
- File upload and document management
- In-app notification system
- Client-facing dashboard with KPIs and status indicators
- Admin view: see all clients, manage accounts, view activity
- Search and filtering across all data views
- Email notifications for key events (new message, status change, file uploaded)

**Premium ($2,497) — Complete Platform**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Full admin panel with user management, analytics, and system settings
- REST API for integrating with your other tools (CRM, billing, Zapier, n8n)
- Role-based access control (admin, staff, client — with granular permissions)
- Third-party integrations (Stripe for payments, SendGrid for email, or your preferred tools)
- Automated workflows (e.g., new client onboarding sequence, project stage notifications)
- Custom domain deployment with SSL
- Full technical documentation + API docs
- 30 days of post-launch support for bug fixes and adjustments

### Why Me
This is not a WordPress plugin with a login page bolted on. I build client portals as custom web applications using the same technology stack that powers production SaaS products — Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. You get a portal that is fast, secure, and built to grow with your business.

I am a CTO and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I have architected and built production platforms handling real users and real data. When I build your portal, I am thinking about security, scalability, and user experience the way a CTO would — not just getting something to render on screen.

### My Process
1. **Discovery & architecture:** I map out your portal's features, user flows, and data model in a clear spec document. You approve the architecture before development begins — no surprises.
2. **Build in sprints:** I develop in weekly sprints with a staging link you can review throughout. You see real progress every week and can give feedback as we go, not just at the end.
3. **Deploy & support:** I deploy the portal to production, run security checks, set up monitoring, and hand over full source code with documentation. Premium includes 30 days of post-launch support so you are never left hanging after delivery.

### FAQ

1. **Q: What technology do you build with?**
   A: Next.js 14 (React framework), Supabase (PostgreSQL database + authentication), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This is the same stack used by modern SaaS companies. It is fast, secure, well-documented, and easy for any developer to maintain after handoff.

2. **Q: Can my clients use this on their phones?**
   A: Yes. Every portal is fully responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers. No native app required — clients just open the URL and log in.

3. **Q: Will I own the source code?**
   A: 100%. Every tier includes full source code handoff. You own it completely. No ongoing licensing fees, no vendor lock-in, no monthly platform charges. You can host it yourself, hire another developer to modify it, or hand it to your internal team.

4. **Q: How much does hosting cost after you deliver?**
   A: Typically $0-25/month. I deploy to Vercel (frontend) and Supabase (backend), both of which have generous free tiers. Most portals with under 10,000 monthly active users run for free or close to it. I will give you a clear cost breakdown before we start.

5. **Q: Can I add features later?**
   A: Absolutely. The portal is built with clean, modular architecture specifically designed to be extended. I can add features as follow-up projects, or your own developer can pick up where I left off thanks to full documentation and TypeScript type safety. Many clients start with Basic and grow into a full platform over time.
