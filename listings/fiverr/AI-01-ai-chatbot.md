## Gig Description

### Hook
Your website visitors have questions at 2 AM and your team is not there to answer them. Every unanswered question is a potential customer who moves on to your competitor. An AI chatbot trained on your business handles those conversations instantly — 24/7, with accurate answers pulled directly from your own content.

**Basic ($127) — FAQ Bot**
- AI chatbot embedded on your website
- Trained on your FAQ content, documents, or knowledge base (up to 50 pages of source material)
- Natural language responses powered by GPT or Claude
- Branded chat widget matching your site design
- Deployment and installation support

**Standard ($497) — Smart Assistant**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Multi-channel deployment (website + one additional channel: Slack, WhatsApp, or Messenger)
- CRM integration to capture leads directly from conversations (HubSpot, GoHighLevel, Salesforce)
- Conversation memory — the bot remembers context within a session
- Handoff to human agent when the bot cannot answer
- Up to 150 pages of source material for training
- 7 days of post-deployment tuning

**Premium ($1,297) — Full AI System**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Customer-facing chatbot with enterprise-grade knowledge base (documents, website scraping, database, API data -- up to 500 pages of source material)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for accurate, grounded responses from your own content
- Conversation analytics dashboard showing chat volume, most-asked questions, resolution rates, and visitor drop-off points
- Custom conversation flows for different visitor segments (new vs. returning, product-specific, support vs. sales)
- Basic lead capture and tagging from conversations (name, email, intent) pushed to your CRM
- 14 days of post-deployment support and optimization

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai — I build AI systems for a living, not as a side hobby. My chatbots use production-grade RAG pipelines with proper embedding models and vector search, which means your bot gives accurate, grounded answers instead of hallucinating. I have built AI assistants that handle real business conversations, qualify leads, and integrate directly into CRM systems. This is not a ChatGPT wrapper — it is a purpose-built system designed for your business.

### My Process
1. **Discovery and content intake:** I learn about your business, your customers, and the types of questions your bot needs to handle. You provide your FAQ content, documents, or website URL, and I structure the knowledge base.
2. **Build and train:** I build the chatbot with your branding, train it on your content, and configure the conversation flows. I test extensively to make sure it handles edge cases and does not make things up.
3. **Deploy and optimize:** I install the chatbot on your website, verify it works across devices, and monitor the first week of conversations. I tune the responses based on real interactions to improve accuracy.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Which AI model do you use — GPT or Claude?**
   A: I recommend the best model for your use case. GPT-4 and Claude both excel at different things. For most business chatbots, Claude tends to give more measured, accurate responses. For creative or multilingual needs, GPT-4 may be the better fit. I will advise you during discovery.

2. **Q: Will the bot make up answers or hallucinate?**
   A: I use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, which means the bot only answers based on your actual content. If it does not have an answer in its knowledge base, it will say so and offer to connect the visitor with a human. No fabricated information.

3. **Q: Can I update the knowledge base myself after delivery?**
   A: Yes. I build the system so you can add, edit, or remove content from the knowledge base without needing a developer. I include documentation and a walkthrough on how to manage it.

4. **Q: What platforms can the chatbot be deployed on?**
   A: Any website (via JavaScript embed), Slack, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram. The Basic tier covers website deployment. Standard and Premium add additional channels.

5. **Q: How much will it cost to run the chatbot monthly?**
   A: Ongoing costs are primarily the AI model API usage. For most small-to-medium businesses, this runs $20-100/month depending on conversation volume. I will give you a cost estimate based on your expected traffic during the discovery call.
