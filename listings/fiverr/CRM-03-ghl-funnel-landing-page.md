## Gig Description

### Hook
Your GoHighLevel account has a funnel builder sitting right there -- but your leads are still landing on a generic website page with no follow-up, no urgency, and no conversion logic. I build GHL funnels that do one thing well: turn traffic into booked calls.

### What You Get

**Basic ($147) -- Single Landing Page**
- 1 custom-designed landing page inside your GHL account
- Lead capture form with field validation
- Thank you / confirmation page
- Basic automation trigger on form submission (e.g., tag contact, send notification)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Deployed on your GHL subdomain or custom domain

**Standard ($347) -- Full Funnel Build**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Multi-step funnel (up to 4 pages: landing, opt-in, offer, thank you)
- Automated SMS + email follow-up sequence (3-5 messages)
- Calendar booking page integration
- Lead tagging and pipeline stage assignment on opt-in
- Countdown timers and urgency elements where appropriate
- 30-minute walkthrough call

**Premium ($697) -- Conversion Machine**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- A/B split testing setup on headline and CTA variations
- Full SMS + email nurture sequence (7-10 messages over 14 days)
- Pipeline integration with stage-based triggers
- Facebook Pixel, Google Tag Manager, and conversion tracking
- Automated appointment reminders (SMS + email)
- Lead scoring based on funnel behavior
- Analytics dashboard showing conversion rates per step
- 45-minute strategy + training call

### Why Me
I have been building conversion funnels for over a decade -- long before GHL existed. The difference between a page that converts at 2% and one that converts at 15% is not a template. It is the automation behind it: what happens the second someone fills out that form, what they see next, and what messages hit their phone in the first 5 minutes. I build all of that inside your GHL account so nothing depends on third-party tools.

I am the founder of PrettyFly.ai and I serve as CTO for a construction enterprise. I bring production-level thinking to every funnel build -- proper tracking, tested sequences, and documentation so you can actually manage it after handoff.

### My Process
1. **Strategy session (15 min):** I learn your offer, audience, and traffic source. A funnel for Facebook ads needs a completely different structure than one for organic search. I do not build until I understand the context.
2. **Design & build:** I create your pages, forms, and automations inside your GHL account. You get a staging link to review before anything goes live. Copy, layout, and sequences are all tailored to your specific offer.
3. **Test & launch:** I run test submissions through every step, verify automations fire correctly, check mobile rendering, and hand you a documented system with a walkthrough call so you know exactly how to monitor performance and make changes.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Do I need a GoHighLevel account already?**
   A: Yes, you need an active GHL account with funnel builder access (most plans include it). I build everything inside your account so you own it. If you are not on GHL yet, I can help you pick the right plan.

2. **Q: Can you write the copy for the landing page?**
   A: I write conversion-focused copy as part of every build. If you already have copy you love, I will use it. If not, I write headlines, body text, CTAs, and email/SMS sequences based on your offer and audience. This is not a design-only service.

3. **Q: Will this work with my existing GHL workflows?**
   A: Absolutely. I build funnels to integrate with your existing pipelines, tags, and workflows. If you have an existing setup, I will audit it first to make sure everything connects cleanly. No duplicate contacts, no broken triggers.

4. **Q: Can I send Facebook or Google Ads traffic to this funnel?**
   A: Yes. The Premium tier includes full tracking pixel setup for Facebook Ads and Google Ads. Standard and Basic funnels are still ad-ready -- I just set up the tracking separately if you need it.

5. **Q: How do I know if the funnel is actually converting?**
   A: Premium includes an analytics dashboard showing conversion rates at every step. For Basic and Standard, I configure GHL's built-in reporting so you can see form submissions, bookings, and pipeline movement without any extra tools.
