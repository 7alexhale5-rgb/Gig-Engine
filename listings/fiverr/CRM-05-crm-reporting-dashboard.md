## Gig Description

### Hook
Your CRM has data. Good data. But nobody can get to it without exporting CSVs and building pivot tables in Excel. Your sales manager wants a pipeline report, your CEO wants revenue forecasts, and your marketing team wants lead source attribution — and right now, producing any of those takes someone an hour of manual work. I build CRM reports and dashboards that surface the numbers your team needs, automatically, in a format they can actually use.

### What You Get

**Basic ($197) — Report Suite**
- 5 custom reports built inside your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, GoHighLevel, Pipedrive, or Zoho)
- Filters for date range, pipeline stage, owner, source, and custom fields
- Visualizations: bar charts, line graphs, funnel charts, and summary tables
- Scheduled email delivery (daily, weekly, or monthly reports sent automatically)
- Report documentation explaining what each report measures and how to interpret it

**Standard ($497) — Sales Dashboard**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Interactive dashboard with 10+ reports on a single view
- Pipeline visualization: stage-by-stage conversion rates and velocity
- Team leaderboard: activity metrics, close rates, and revenue per rep
- Lead source attribution: which channels produce the most revenue
- Automated alerts: notifications when deals are stuck, quotas are at risk, or key metrics change
- Mobile-accessible dashboard
- 7 days of post-delivery support

**Premium ($897) — Analytics Platform**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Revenue forecasting based on pipeline data and historical close rates
- Multi-touch attribution: track the full customer journey from first touch to close
- Cohort analysis: how do leads from different time periods perform over time?
- Data enrichment via API integrations (pull in data from marketing tools, ad platforms, or external sources)
- Executive summary reports: automated weekly/monthly email with key metrics and trends in plain language
- Custom calculated fields and derived metrics
- Dashboard for each role: sales reps see their numbers, managers see team numbers, executives see company numbers
- Full documentation and training
- 14 days of post-delivery support

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I have built CRM reporting systems for businesses that run on their pipeline — where knowing your conversion rate by stage, your average deal velocity, and your lead source ROI is not a nice-to-have, it is how you make decisions. I know what reports actually get used (and which ones get ignored), because I build them for my own business and my clients every month.

### My Process
1. **Metrics discovery:** I interview your sales manager, marketing lead, and executive team to understand what numbers they need and what decisions those numbers inform. I deliver a report spec listing every metric, its data source, and its visualization — you approve before I build.
2. **Build and validate:** I create the reports and dashboards inside your CRM, using your real data. I verify the numbers are accurate by cross-referencing against your raw data. You get a preview link to review and request adjustments.
3. **Deploy and train:** I finalize the dashboards, set up scheduled delivery, configure alerts, and walk your team through how to use everything. Each user gets access to the reports relevant to their role.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Which CRM platforms do you work with?**
   A: HubSpot, Salesforce, GoHighLevel, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, and Close. If your CRM has a reporting API, I can likely build on it. For CRMs with limited built-in reporting, I can build an external dashboard that pulls from your CRM via API.

2. **Q: Can you connect data from outside the CRM?**
   A: Yes, in Premium tier. I can pull data from Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Mailchimp, Google Analytics, and other marketing tools to create unified reports. This is how multi-touch attribution works — it requires data from more than just the CRM.

3. **Q: Will the reports update automatically?**
   A: Yes. All reports pull live data from your CRM — when a deal moves stages or a new lead comes in, the report reflects it immediately. Scheduled reports are sent at the cadence you choose.

4. **Q: Can different team members see different reports?**
   A: Yes. I configure role-based access so each person sees the data relevant to their job. Sales reps see their own performance, managers see their team, and executives see company-wide metrics.

5. **Q: What if our CRM data is messy?**
   A: I will flag data quality issues during the metrics discovery phase — missing fields, inconsistent naming, duplicate records. For Standard and Premium tiers, I include a data cleanup pass as part of the project. Clean data in means accurate reports out.
