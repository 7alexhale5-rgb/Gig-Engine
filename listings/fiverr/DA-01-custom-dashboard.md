### Hook
You are making decisions off of spreadsheets, scattered reports, and gut feelings when you should have every number that matters on one screen, updating in real time. This is not a spreadsheet with charts — it is a custom web application built specifically for your data.

### Why Me
I am a CTO and full-stack developer — not a BI tool reseller. Your dashboard is built as a custom React web application with a real database behind it, not a Looker Studio embed or a Tableau license you have to pay for monthly. It loads fast, looks sharp, and does exactly what you need because it was built for your business and nothing else.

I am the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I build production-grade systems using modern technologies (React, Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript) at AI-powered development speed. You get the quality of a dev team without the agency price tag.

### My Process
1. **Data audit:** I review your data sources, identify the metrics that actually matter, and wireframe the dashboard layout so you approve the design before a single line of code is written.
2. **Build & connect:** I build the dashboard as a custom web application, connect your data sources, and configure real-time updates. You get a staging link to review throughout development.
3. **Deploy & hand off:** I deploy the dashboard to a live URL, test across devices, and hand you the source code with documentation. No vendor lock-in — you own it completely.

### FAQ

1. **Q: What data sources can you connect to?**
   A: Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Supabase), REST APIs, Google Sheets, Airtable, CSV files, Firebase, HubSpot, Salesforce, Stripe, QuickBooks, and most platforms with an API. If your data is accessible, I can connect it.

2. **Q: Is this a template or a custom build?**
   A: Fully custom. Every dashboard I build is designed from scratch for your specific data and business needs. No templates, no page builders, no monthly software fees. You own the source code.

3. **Q: Can my team access it on their phones?**
   A: Yes. Every dashboard is fully responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers. No app download required — just open the URL.

4. **Q: Will I need to pay for hosting or software licenses?**
   A: Hosting is minimal — typically $0-20/month depending on your data volume. There are no software licenses, no per-seat charges, and no monthly platform fees. I deploy to services like Vercel or Railway that have generous free tiers for most use cases.

5. **Q: Can I add more features or pages later?**
   A: Absolutely. The dashboard is built with clean, modular code specifically so it can grow with your business. I can add new pages, data sources, or features as a follow-up project. Many clients start with Basic and expand to a full command center over time.
