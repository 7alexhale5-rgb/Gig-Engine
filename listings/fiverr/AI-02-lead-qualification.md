## Gig Description

### Hook
Your sales team is spending hours chasing leads that were never going to close, while high-intent buyers sit untouched in your pipeline. Without a scoring system, every lead looks the same — and that means wasted time, missed revenue, and a sales process that does not scale.

### What You Get

**Basic ($197) — Lead Scoring Model**
- Custom scoring model based on your ideal customer profile and historical close data
- Rules-based scoring engine (demographic fit, behavioral signals, engagement level)
- CRM field mapping — scores and tags automatically applied to leads
- Scoring criteria documentation so your team understands how leads are ranked
- Integration with 1 CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, GoHighLevel, or Pipedrive)

**Standard ($697) — AI-Powered Scoring**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- AI-driven scoring that adapts based on patterns in your data — not just static rules
- Real-time lead scoring as new data comes in (form submissions, email opens, page visits)
- Automated lead routing — hot leads go to senior reps, nurture-stage leads go to sequences
- CRM workflow automation triggered by score thresholds (alerts, task creation, status changes)
- Bi-directional CRM sync so scores update as leads engage
- 7 days of model tuning based on real results

**Premium ($1,497) — Full Qualification System**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Internal lead scoring engine with deep CRM integration -- scores, tags, and routes leads automatically inside your existing sales workflow
- Multi-source data enrichment (form data + browsing behavior + email engagement + conversation history) feeding into a unified lead score
- Automated CRM routing rules by territory, product line, deal size, or score threshold -- hot leads to senior reps, nurture-stage leads to drip sequences
- Automated follow-up sequences triggered by qualification outcome (not a chatbot -- backend automation that works silently inside your CRM)
- Sales performance dashboard showing qualification rates, conversion by score tier, pipeline velocity, and rep-level metrics
- Full documentation and team training session
- 14 days of post-deployment optimization

### Why Me
I am a CTO and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I have built AI systems that process real business data at scale — not proof-of-concept demos. My lead qualification systems combine rule-based scoring with actual AI analysis, giving you both the predictability of defined criteria and the intelligence of pattern recognition. I have integrated these systems into every major CRM and understand how sales teams actually work. Your system will be built to drive revenue, not just generate a score.

### My Process
1. **Sales process audit:** I review your current sales pipeline, ideal customer profile, CRM setup, and historical close data. I identify the signals that actually predict whether a lead converts — not vanity metrics.
2. **Build and integrate:** I build the scoring model, connect it to your CRM, configure the routing rules, and test against your existing lead data to validate accuracy before going live.
3. **Deploy and optimize:** I deploy the system, monitor the first wave of scored leads, and tune the model based on your team's feedback and actual conversion outcomes. You get a system that improves over time.

### FAQ
1. **Q: What CRM systems do you support?**
   A: HubSpot, Salesforce, GoHighLevel, Pipedrive, and any CRM with an API. If you are using a less common platform, message me and I will confirm compatibility before you order.

2. **Q: How much historical data do I need for AI scoring to work?**
   A: For the rules-based Basic tier, no historical data is required — we build the model from your ideal customer criteria. For the AI-powered Standard and Premium tiers, I recommend at least 200-500 closed leads (mix of won and lost) for the model to identify meaningful patterns. If you have less, I will start with rules-based scoring and layer in AI as your data grows.

3. **Q: Will this replace my sales team?**
   A: No — it makes your sales team dramatically more effective. The system scores and prioritizes leads so your reps focus on the highest-value opportunities first. It handles the qualification busywork so your people spend their time closing, not sorting.

4. **Q: How does the AI chatbot qualification work (Premium tier)?**
   A: The chatbot engages website visitors with targeted qualifying questions based on your criteria. It collects key information (company size, budget range, timeline, pain points), scores the lead in real-time, and either routes hot leads to your sales team immediately or places cooler leads into nurture sequences. All conversation data flows into your CRM automatically.

5. **Q: Can the scoring model be updated over time?**
   A: Yes. The system is built to evolve. On the Standard and Premium tiers, the AI model can be retrained as you accumulate more conversion data. I also document the scoring criteria so your team can adjust weights and thresholds without needing a developer for basic changes.
