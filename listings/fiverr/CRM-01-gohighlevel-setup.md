## Gig Description

### Hook
You bought GoHighLevel because it promised to automate your entire business — but right now it is just an expensive app sitting on your phone doing nothing. I have built GHL systems for 15+ service businesses that generate reviews, route leads, and close deals on autopilot.

### What You Get

**Basic ($127) — Starter Pipeline**
- 1 custom pipeline configured to your sales process
- 1 workflow automation (e.g., new lead follow-up, missed call text-back, or appointment reminder)
- Basic lead routing rules
- Pipeline stage definitions with clear actions
- Written documentation for your setup

**Standard ($497) — Full CRM Build**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- 3 workflow automations tailored to your business
- Full pipeline automation (stage triggers, task assignments, notifications)
- Automated review request sequence (SMS + email)
- Contact tagging and segmentation strategy

### Why Me
I am a CTO who has been building production systems for over a decade — not a VA following a YouTube tutorial. I have personally built and optimized GoHighLevel systems for 15+ service businesses including contractors, med spas, law firms, and home service companies. Every automation I build is tested, documented, and designed to run without you babysitting it.

I am the founder of PrettyFly.ai, where I use AI-powered development to deliver enterprise-grade systems at freelance speed. You get CTO-level architecture at a fraction of the cost of hiring an agency.

### My Process
1. **Discovery call (15 min):** I learn your sales process, lead sources, and biggest bottlenecks so nothing gets built on assumptions.
2. **Build & configure:** I set up your pipelines, automations, and integrations in your GHL account with proper naming, tagging, and documentation.
3. **Test & train:** I run test leads through every workflow, fix edge cases, and walk you through the system so you actually understand what is happening behind the scenes.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Do I need to already have a GoHighLevel account?**
   A: Yes. You will need an active GHL account (any plan). I build inside your account so you own everything. If you do not have one yet, I can advise on which plan fits your needs before you sign up.

2. **Q: Can you migrate my existing contacts and data into GHL?**
   A: Yes. If you are coming from another CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, a spreadsheet), I can migrate your data as part of the Standard or Premium package. For large migrations (10K+ contacts), we may need to scope that separately.

3. **Q: How many automations can you build in the Basic package?**
   A: The Basic package includes 1 pipeline and 1 workflow automation. Most clients start here to get their most critical workflow running, then upgrade to Standard once they see the results. I am happy to recommend which single automation will have the biggest impact on your business.

4. **Q: Will you teach me how to use the system after it is built?**
   A: Standard includes a 30-minute walkthrough and Premium includes a full 45-minute training call plus a recorded Loom video you can reference anytime. Basic includes written documentation.

5. **Q: What types of businesses have you built GHL systems for?**
   A: Contractors, HVAC companies, med spas, dental offices, law firms, real estate teams, home service companies, and marketing agencies. If you run a service business that generates leads and books appointments, GHL is in my wheelhouse.
