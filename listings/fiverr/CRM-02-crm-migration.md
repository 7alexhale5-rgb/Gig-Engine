### Why Me
I have handled CRM migrations between every major platform: HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, GoHighLevel, Zoho, ActiveCampaign, and more. I am a CTO and founder of PrettyFly.ai — I build production-grade data systems, not drag-and-drop imports. Every migration I run includes a parallel run period so nothing goes dark during the switch.

Most "CRM migration" services are just CSV imports. I rebuild your workflows, validate your data integrity, and make sure your team can actually use the new system on day one.

### My Process
1. **Audit & map:** I export and audit your current CRM data, map every field, tag, pipeline stage, and workflow to the new platform, and flag any data quality issues before we move anything.
2. **Migrate & rebuild:** I run the migration in stages — contacts first, then deals, then workflows — with validation checks at each step. Both CRMs run in parallel so your team keeps working without interruption.
3. **Verify & train:** I run a full data validation pass (record counts, field integrity, workflow triggers), walk your team through the new system, and stay available for 30 days to handle any edge cases that surface post-migration.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Which CRMs can you migrate between?**
   A: I have migrated between HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, GoHighLevel, Zoho CRM, ActiveCampaign, Keap (Infusionsoft), Monday.com, Copper, and custom spreadsheet-based systems. If your CRM has an API or export function, I can work with it.

2. **Q: Will I lose any data during migration?**
   A: No. I take a full CSV backup before touching anything, and I run data validation reports at every stage. You will receive a before-and-after count for contacts, deals, tags, and any other migrated records. If something does not match, we fix it before going live.

3. **Q: How long will both CRMs run in parallel?**
   A: Standard includes a 7-day parallel run. Premium extends this as long as needed. During the parallel run, your team continues working in the old CRM while I verify everything in the new one. The cutover only happens when you give the green light.

4. **Q: What about our existing automations and workflows?**
   A: Basic covers data only. Standard rebuilds up to 5 workflows in the new platform. Premium rebuilds everything — automations, email sequences, lead routing, task assignments, all of it. I document each workflow before and after so you have a clear record.

5. **Q: Can you also set up our new CRM from scratch if we do not have one yet?**
   A: Absolutely. Many clients hire me to both select and set up their new CRM. I can recommend the best platform for your business, then handle the full setup and migration as a single project. Just message me and I will scope it for your needs.

### CTA
Planning a CRM switch? Message me with your current platform and where you are headed -- I will give you an honest migration scope and timeline before you commit to anything.

## Requirements
- Admin access to your current CRM (or a full data export)
- Admin access to your new CRM (or tell me which platform you are moving to and I will help you set it up)
- List of all workflows, automations, and email sequences you want migrated
- Any custom fields or tags that are critical to your operations
- Number of contacts, deals, and users to migrate (rough estimate is fine)
- Timeline constraints (e.g., "we need to be off Salesforce by March 1")
- Names and roles of team members who will need training on the new system
