## Gig Description

### Hook
Your leads are going cold because nobody follows up fast enough or often enough. Manual follow-up doesn't scale — you forget, you get busy, and every missed touchpoint is revenue walking out the door. I build automated email and SMS sequences that follow up for you, at the right time, with the right message, based on what each lead actually does.

### What You Get

**Basic ($147) — Starter Sequence**
- 1 automated email drip sequence (5-7 emails)
- Trigger setup — new lead, form submission, or tag-based enrollment
- Basic personalization with merge fields
- Unsubscribe and compliance handling
- Sequence deployed and tested in your email platform

**Standard ($347) — Multi-Channel System**
- Email + SMS sequence working together (8-12 touchpoints total)
- Conditional branching — different paths based on opens, clicks, replies
- Lead scoring triggers that escalate hot leads to your sales team
- A/B testing setup on subject lines or send times
- Platform integration (CRM, form tools, landing pages)
- Full documentation with sequence flow diagram
- 7 days of post-delivery monitoring

**Premium ($697) — Full Nurture Engine**
- Complete multi-channel nurture system (15-20+ touchpoints)
- Email, SMS, and webhook-triggered actions
- Behavioral triggers — page visits, link clicks, cart abandonment, inactivity
- Dynamic content blocks that change based on lead attributes
- Re-engagement sequences for cold leads
- Reporting dashboard — open rates, click rates, conversion tracking
- Integration with CRM and sales pipeline for handoff automation
- Full documentation with architecture overview
- 14 days of post-delivery support and optimization

### Why Me
I'm the founder of PrettyFly.ai and I've built nurture sequences that actually convert — not just blast emails that land in spam. The difference is in the logic: when to send, what to send based on behavior, when to switch channels from email to SMS, and when to stop and hand off to a human. I build across Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, GoHighLevel, SendGrid, Twilio, and more. I think about deliverability, timing, and conversion — not just "set up a drip."

### My Process
1. **Map your funnel:** We walk through your lead sources, your offer, and what a successful conversion looks like. I design the sequence flow — which messages, which channels, which triggers, and which conditions change the path.
2. **Build and configure:** I build every email and SMS step in your platform, set up triggers and conditions, configure personalization, and connect to your CRM or lead source.
3. **Test and launch:** I send test messages through every branch of the sequence, verify deliverability, confirm tracking works, and launch. You get full documentation so you can tweak copy or timing without calling me back.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Which email/SMS platforms do you work with?**
   A: Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, GoHighLevel, HubSpot, ConvertKit, SendGrid, Brevo, Twilio, and most platforms with API access. If yours isn't listed, message me — I've probably used it.

2. **Q: Do you write the email and SMS copy?**
   A: I focus on the automation architecture — triggers, timing, branching, and technical setup. If you need copywriting, I can recommend someone or work with your existing copy. I'll advise on structure, length, and CTA placement based on what converts.

3. **Q: Will my emails land in spam?**
   A: I configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC if they're not already set up, and I follow deliverability best practices: proper list hygiene, warmup pacing, unsubscribe handling, and content structure. I can't guarantee inbox placement (nobody honestly can), but I set you up for the best possible deliverability.

4. **Q: Can you connect the sequence to my CRM?**
   A: Yes. Standard and Premium tiers include CRM integration. When a lead hits a certain score or takes a key action, they get tagged, moved to a pipeline stage, or assigned to a rep automatically.

5. **Q: What if I need to change the copy or timing later?**
   A: The documentation I provide covers exactly how to edit each step. Your team can adjust copy, timing, and conditions without touching the automation logic. If you need structural changes, I'm available for follow-up work.

### CTA
Message me with your lead source, your offer, and what "conversion" means for your business. I'll sketch a sequence flow and recommend the right tier — takes me 15 minutes, costs you nothing.

## Requirements
- Access to your email/SMS platform (or willingness to set one up — I'll recommend)
- Description of your lead sources (forms, ads, website, referrals, etc.)
- Your offer or product — what are you selling and to whom
- Any existing email sequences or templates you want to build on
- Preferred voice/tone for messaging (or examples of past emails you liked)
- CRM access if you want lead scoring and pipeline integration
