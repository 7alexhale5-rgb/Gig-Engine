## Gig Description

### Hook
You have a SaaS idea or a business process that needs to become a web app. You don't need a 6-month development cycle or a $50K agency contract — you need a working product that real users can sign up for, use, and pay you for. That's what I build.

### What You Get

**Basic ($497) — MVP Foundation**
- 1 core feature module built around your primary use case
- User authentication (email/password signup, login, password reset)
- PostgreSQL database with proper schema design
- Clean, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Deployed to Vercel + Supabase on a live URL
- Source code handoff with setup documentation

**Standard ($1,497) — Full MVP**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Up to 3 feature modules (e.g., user dashboard, data management, reporting)
- Admin panel for managing users, content, and application data
- REST API endpoints for future integrations
- File upload and storage
- Email notifications for key user actions
- Search, filtering, and pagination across data views
- Open Graph and SEO metadata

**Premium ($2,997) — Production SaaS**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Up to 5 feature modules covering your full MVP scope
- Stripe integration for subscriptions, one-time payments, or usage-based billing
- Admin dashboard with analytics, user metrics, and revenue tracking
- Role-based access control (admin, staff, user — configurable permissions)
- Webhook endpoints for third-party integrations
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment
- Full technical documentation + API reference
- 30 days of post-launch support for bug fixes and adjustments

### Why Me
I'm a CTO who builds SaaS products for a living. I've taken apps from napkin sketch to production with paying users — not just demo-ready prototypes that fall apart when real traffic hits them. My stack is Next.js 14, Supabase, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It's the same stack I use for my own products because it ships fast and scales without rewriting.

I'm the founder of PrettyFly.ai. When I build your MVP, I'm thinking about the things most freelancers skip: database indexing, auth edge cases, error handling, mobile responsiveness, and what happens when you need to add features in month two. You get production-quality code, not a hackathon project.

### My Process
1. **Scope & architecture:** I break down your product into feature modules, design the database schema, and map out the user flows in a clear spec document. You sign off on the architecture before I write a line of code — so we're aligned on exactly what gets built.
2. **Build in sprints:** I develop in weekly sprints with a live staging link you can test throughout. You see working features every week, give feedback in real time, and never have to wonder what stage things are at.
3. **Launch & support:** I deploy to production, run security checks, set up error monitoring, and walk you through the codebase. Premium includes 30 days of post-launch support so you can focus on getting users while I handle any issues that come up.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Can you build my specific SaaS idea?**
   A: Most likely, yes. I've built CRMs, client portals, booking systems, dashboards, internal tools, and marketplace MVPs. Message me with a quick description of what you're building and I'll tell you straight whether it fits my stack and timeline — no sales pitch, just an honest answer.

2. **Q: What technology do you use?**
   A: Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This is a modern, well-documented stack that any competent developer can maintain after handoff. No proprietary frameworks, no vendor lock-in.

3. **Q: Will I own the code?**
   A: Yes. Every tier includes full source code handoff. You own it completely — host it wherever you want, modify it, hire another developer to extend it. No ongoing fees to me, no licensing, no strings.

4. **Q: How much does hosting cost after delivery?**
   A: Vercel and Supabase both have generous free tiers. Most MVPs run for $0-25/month until you have significant traffic. If you're on the Premium tier with Stripe, Stripe takes their standard processing fee but there's no additional platform cost from my side.

5. **Q: What if I need more features after launch?**
   A: That's expected — MVPs are supposed to grow. The codebase is built with clean, modular architecture so adding features later is straightforward. I'm available for follow-up work, or your own team can pick it up. Premium clients get 30 days of post-launch support included.
