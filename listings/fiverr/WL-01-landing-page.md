## Gig Description

You have 3 seconds to prove to a visitor they should stay on your page instead of hitting the back button. Most landing pages waste that window with walls of text, slow load times, and buried calls to action — and you are paying for every click that bounces.

- Deployed to your domain or a staging URL

**Standard ($347) — Conversion Kit**

### Why Me
I am a CTO and full-stack developer who builds landing pages the way they should be built: fast-loading, conversion-focused, and backed by real code — not a drag-and-drop page builder that tanks your page speed score. Every page I build scores 90+ on Google PageSpeed Insights because performance is not optional when you are paying for traffic.

I am the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I combine CTO-level technical expertise with conversion copywriting principles so your page does not just look good — it converts.

### My Process
1. **Strategy call:** I learn your offer, target audience, and traffic source so the page is designed to convert your specific visitors — not a generic template for a generic audience.
2. **Design & build:** I design the page layout, write conversion-focused copy (or refine yours), and build it with clean, fast-loading code. You review a staging link and we iterate until it is right.
3. **Launch & track:** I deploy the page to your domain, set up analytics and conversion tracking, and hand you a performance baseline so you know exactly how the page is performing from day one.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Do you write the copy or do I need to provide it?**
   A: I can do either. If you have existing copy, I will optimize it for conversion. If you need copy written from scratch, I can handle that — just give me your offer details, target audience, and key selling points. Premium includes full copywriting for the landing page and 3 follow-up emails.

2. **Q: What platform do you build on?**
   A: I build with custom code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript or Next.js) for maximum speed and flexibility. No WordPress page builders, no Wix, no Squarespace — just clean code that loads fast and you own completely. If you need it on a specific platform (GoHighLevel, WordPress, Webflow), I can accommodate that too.

3. **Q: How fast will the page load?**
   A: I target a 90+ score on Google PageSpeed Insights for every page. Fast load times directly improve conversion rates and ad quality scores. If your current page is slow, a rebuild alone can boost conversions significantly.

4. **Q: Can you integrate with my CRM or email marketing tool?**
   A: Yes. Standard and Premium include CRM integration. I work with GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit, Klaviyo, and most platforms that accept webhooks or have an API.

5. **Q: Will the page be SEO-friendly?**
   A: Every tier includes on-page SEO fundamentals: proper heading structure, meta tags, alt text, semantic HTML, and fast load times. Premium adds schema markup and a Core Web Vitals optimization pass for the best possible search engine performance.
