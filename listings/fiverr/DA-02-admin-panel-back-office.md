## Gig Description

### Hook
You are managing your business through a spreadsheet that three people edit simultaneously and nobody trusts. Or you are paying $200/month for a SaaS tool that does 10% of what you need and 90% of what you do not. I build custom admin panels that do exactly what your operations require -- nothing more, nothing less.

### What You Get

**Basic ($397) -- Single Module**
- 1 CRUD module built for your specific data (e.g., customers, orders, inventory, projects)
- Data table with sorting, searching, and filtering
- Create, edit, and delete forms with validation
- Basic authentication (login/logout)
- Clean, responsive UI that works on desktop and tablet
- Deployed to a live URL

**Standard ($897) -- Multi-Module Admin Panel**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- 3 CRUD modules tailored to your business operations
- Role-based access control (admin, manager, viewer -- or your custom roles)
- Data import from CSV and export to CSV/Excel
- Activity logging (who changed what, when)
- Sidebar navigation with module organization
- Responsive design for mobile access
- 30-minute walkthrough call

**Premium ($1,797) -- Full Back-Office System**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Unlimited CRUD modules for all your operational data
- Advanced RBAC with granular permissions per module
- API integrations with your existing tools (Stripe, QuickBooks, Slack, etc.)
- Bulk operations (mass update, mass delete, batch processing)
- Full audit trail with change history
- Reporting widgets and summary cards on the dashboard
- Email notifications for key events
- Full deployment to your domain with SSL
- Source code + documentation + architecture diagram
- 45-minute training call + Loom recording

### Why Me
I build admin panels and internal tools professionally -- it is a core part of what I do as a CTO. The admin panel I built for my own construction enterprise handles project tracking, vendor management, and financial reporting for a multi-million dollar operation. That same level of architecture goes into every build, whether it is a simple order tracker or a full back-office platform.

I am the founder of PrettyFly.ai. My stack is React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase -- the same tools companies like Vercel and Stripe use. Your admin panel is not a WordPress plugin or a Retool embed. It is a real application you own completely.

### My Process
1. **Requirements session (30 min):** I map out your data model, user roles, and the workflows your team needs. We agree on every module, field, and permission before I write any code. No surprises.
2. **Build in sprints:** I deliver working modules incrementally. You see a staging link within the first week and can test real functionality -- not just mockups. Feedback loops are tight so changes are cheap.
3. **Deploy & train:** I deploy to your domain, run through every workflow with your team, and hand over source code with full documentation. You own the code. No monthly fees, no vendor lock-in.

### FAQ

1. **Q: What technology do you use to build admin panels?**
   A: React and Next.js on the frontend, Supabase (PostgreSQL) on the backend, TypeScript throughout, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It is a modern, maintainable stack that any competent developer can work with after handoff.

2. **Q: Can this connect to my existing database or API?**
   A: Yes. I can build on top of your existing database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) or connect to your existing APIs. If you want a fresh database, I set up Supabase with proper schema design, row-level security, and migrations.

3. **Q: How is this different from Retool or other no-code admin builders?**
   A: You own the code. No per-seat pricing, no monthly platform fee, no feature limitations. It is a real application deployed to your infrastructure. It also performs better, looks better, and can be customized to do things no-code tools cannot.

4. **Q: Can I add more modules later?**
   A: Yes. The architecture is modular by design. Adding a new CRUD module is straightforward and can be done as a follow-up project. Many clients start with Basic and expand over time.

5. **Q: Will my team need technical skills to use it?**
   A: No. The interface is designed for non-technical users. If your team can use a spreadsheet, they can use this. I design intuitive forms, clear labels, and helpful validation messages so nobody needs a manual to get their job done.
