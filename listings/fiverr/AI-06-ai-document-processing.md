## Gig Description

### Hook
Your team processes hundreds of documents manually — reading invoices, keying data into spreadsheets, cross-referencing contracts, filing forms. It is slow, error-prone, and nobody enjoys it. One typo in an invoice number and the whole reconciliation breaks. AI document processing reads your documents, extracts the data you need, validates it, and delivers it in a structured format — in seconds, not hours, with accuracy that improves over time.

### What You Get

**Basic ($197) — Document Extractor**
- AI-powered extraction from 1 document type (invoices, receipts, purchase orders, forms, contracts, or similar)
- Structured output: extracted fields delivered as JSON, CSV, or directly into your database/spreadsheet
- OCR for scanned documents and images (not just digital PDFs)
- Field mapping: I configure which fields to extract (dates, amounts, names, line items, etc.)
- Confidence scoring: each extracted value includes a confidence percentage
- 50 test documents processed to validate accuracy
- Deployed as a script or API endpoint you can call

**Standard ($497) — Multi-Doc Pipeline**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Support for 3-5 document types with automatic classification (the system figures out what type of document it is looking at)
- Validation rules: cross-check extracted data against business rules (amounts must be positive, dates must be in range, required fields must be present)
- Error handling: documents that fail validation are flagged for human review instead of being silently wrong
- Database storage with searchable index of all processed documents
- Batch processing: drop a folder of documents and they all get processed
- Processing dashboard showing throughput, accuracy, and flagged items
- 7 days of post-delivery support

**Premium ($1,197) — Document Intelligence**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- 5+ document types with intelligent routing (different extraction rules per type)
- Workflow integration: extracted data triggers actions (create invoice in accounting system, update CRM record, send notification)
- Human-in-the-loop verification for low-confidence extractions
- Learning loop: corrections feed back to improve extraction accuracy over time
- API with webhook support for integration with your existing systems
- Document comparison: detect changes between document versions
- Audit trail for compliance (who processed what, when, what was extracted)
- Full documentation and training
- 21 days of post-delivery support

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. In construction, document processing is not optional — we handle purchase orders, invoices, change orders, inspection reports, and compliance forms daily. I built our internal document processing pipeline that extracts line items from vendor invoices and matches them against purchase orders automatically. I understand both the AI technology and the business context: you need accuracy, speed, and a system that handles the messy real-world documents your team actually deals with.

### My Process
1. **Document analysis:** I review samples of your documents (10-20 examples per type), identify the fields to extract, and document any variations in format or layout. You approve the extraction spec — a list of every field the system will capture — before I build.
2. **Build and train:** I build the extraction pipeline using the best tool for your document type (GPT-4 Vision for complex layouts, specialized OCR for structured forms, or a hybrid approach). I test against your sample documents and iterate until accuracy meets your threshold (typically 95%+ for well-formatted docs).
3. **Deploy and validate:** I deploy the system, process a batch of real documents with your team reviewing the output, and refine any edge cases. You get documentation, a processing dashboard, and confidence that the system handles your documents correctly.

### FAQ
1. **Q: What types of documents can you process?**
   A: Invoices, receipts, purchase orders, contracts, tax forms, medical records, insurance claims, shipping documents, bank statements, resumes, legal filings — essentially any document with structured or semi-structured data. If the information follows a pattern, AI can extract it.

2. **Q: How accurate is the extraction?**
   A: For well-formatted digital documents (typed PDFs, forms), accuracy is typically 95-99%. For scanned documents or handwritten content, 85-95% depending on quality. Every extraction includes confidence scores, and low-confidence items get flagged for human review rather than being accepted silently.

3. **Q: Can it handle scanned or photographed documents?**
   A: Yes. The pipeline includes OCR (optical character recognition) that handles scanned PDFs, photos of documents, and even slightly skewed or low-quality images. For best results, I recommend at least 200 DPI scans, but the system handles less-than-ideal inputs gracefully.

4. **Q: What about documents in other languages?**
   A: The AI models I use support 50+ languages. I can configure extraction for non-English documents — the main requirement is that I have sample documents in the target language to validate the extraction rules.

5. **Q: Can we reprocess documents if we need to add new fields later?**
   A: Yes. All original documents are stored, so adding new extraction fields is a configuration change, not a reprocessing nightmare. I can add new fields and reprocess your historical documents in a single batch run.

### CTA
Send me 5-10 sample documents (the types your team processes most) and tell me what data you need extracted — I will show you what the structured output looks like and recommend the right tier.

## Requirements
- Sample documents (10-20 per type, redacted if sensitive)
- List of fields to extract from each document type
- Current process: how does your team handle these documents today?
- Desired output format (JSON, CSV, database, spreadsheet, or API)
- Volume: how many documents per day/week/month?
- Any validation rules or business logic (e.g., invoice totals must match line items)
- Integration requirements (accounting system, CRM, database, etc.)
- For Premium: workflow routing rules (what happens after extraction?)
