## Gig Description

### Hook
That Google Sheet is running your business. It started as a quick tracker and now it has 47 tabs, 15 people editing it simultaneously, broken formulas nobody understands, and a loading time measured in coffee breaks. The data is too important for a spreadsheet and your team deserves a real tool. I take your spreadsheet — whatever state it is in — and turn it into a proper web application with a database, user accounts, and an interface that actually works.

### What You Get

**Basic ($197) — Data App**
- Your spreadsheet data migrated to a PostgreSQL database with correct data types and relationships
- Clean web interface for viewing your data (table view with sorting and pagination)
- Basic CRUD: add, edit, and delete records through the UI
- Data validation rules so bad data cannot get in
- Deployed to a live URL your team can access from any device
- Source code handoff

**Standard ($497) — Full App**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Multiple views and pages organized by your workflow (not 47 tabs)
- Forms with validation for data entry
- Search, filtering, and date range selection
- User authentication (each team member has their own login)
- Activity log: see who changed what and when
- Data import from CSV for bulk uploads
- Data export to CSV for reporting
- Mobile-responsive design
- 7 days of post-delivery support

**Premium ($997) — Operations Platform**

- Role-based access control (admin, editor, viewer)
- Workflow automation: status changes trigger notifications, assignments, or follow-up tasks
- Email or Slack notifications for key events
- Calculated fields and summary statistics (totals, averages, counts per category)
- API endpoints for integration with your other tools
- Dashboard view with charts and KPI cards
- Full documentation and architecture overview
- 21 days of post-delivery support

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I have migrated more spreadsheets into applications than I can count — project trackers, equipment logs, inventory systems, client databases, job costing sheets. Every one was critical to the business and every one was held together with duct tape formulas and manual processes. I know how to untangle the logic buried in your spreadsheet and rebuild it as a proper application without losing any of the functionality your team depends on.

### My Process
1. **Spreadsheet audit:** I review your spreadsheet, document every tab, column, formula, and workflow. I identify what is data, what is logic, and what is presentational. You get a migration plan showing exactly how each piece maps to the new application.
2. **Build and migrate:** I design the database schema, build the application interface, migrate your data, and recreate any calculations or automations. You get a staging link to test with your real data before we go live.
3. **Cutover and train:** I help your team transition from the spreadsheet to the app, verify all data migrated correctly, and provide documentation and a walkthrough. The spreadsheet stays available as a backup until you are confident in the new system.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Will we lose any data during migration?**
   A: No. I migrate all your data into the new database and verify record counts match. The original spreadsheet is preserved as a backup. I handle data cleaning during migration — fixing inconsistent formats, removing duplicates, and normalizing values.

2. **Q: My spreadsheet has complex formulas — can you replicate them?**
   A: Yes. Formulas become proper application logic — calculated fields, derived metrics, conditional formatting, and aggregations. These are more reliable in an application because they are enforced by the system, not dependent on someone accidentally editing a formula cell.

3. **Q: Can my team still export data to a spreadsheet?**
   A: Absolutely. Every tier includes CSV export. Your team can pull data into Excel or Google Sheets whenever they need to do ad-hoc analysis. The difference is that the source of truth is now the application, not the spreadsheet.

4. **Q: What if we need to add fields or views later?**
   A: The application is built with clean, modular code so adding new fields, views, or features is straightforward. I can do it as a follow-up project, or a developer on your team can extend it using the documentation.

5. **Q: How many users can access the app?**
   A: No per-seat limits. Whether you have 5 users or 50, the cost is the same. Hosting is typically $0-20/month regardless of user count.

### CTA
Share your spreadsheet with me (or a screenshot if it contains sensitive data) and tell me what drives you crazy about it — I will show you what the app version looks like and recommend the right tier.

## Requirements
- Your spreadsheet file (Google Sheets link, Excel file, or CSV export)
- Description of how your team uses the spreadsheet (the workflows, not just the data)
- List of pain points with the current spreadsheet
- Number of team members who need access and their roles
- Any formulas, automations, or conditional logic that need to be preserved
- Preferred features (forms, notifications, dashboards, etc.)
- Brand guidelines if applicable (logo, colors)
