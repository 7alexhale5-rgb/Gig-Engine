## Gig Description

### Hook
Your CRM has 10,000 contacts and you still cannot answer a basic question like "how many deals did we close last month." I fix HubSpot and Salesforce instances that have been neglected, misconfigured, or outgrown their original setup -- so your CRM actually tells you what is happening in your business.

### What You Get

**Basic ($247) -- Quick Fix**
- Full CRM audit with written report of issues and opportunities
- 1 workflow automation built or repaired (e.g., lead assignment, deal stage trigger, task creation)
- Data cleanup recommendations with prioritized action list
- Property/field audit -- identify unused, duplicate, and misconfigured fields
- 15-minute walkthrough of findings and fixes

**Standard ($597) -- Full Optimization**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- 3 workflow automations built or rebuilt from scratch
- Custom reporting dashboard (pipeline, revenue, activity metrics)
- Contact and deal data hygiene pass (merge duplicates, fix formatting, standardize fields)
- Lead scoring model setup or optimization
- Integration audit (check all connected tools are syncing correctly)
- 30-minute walkthrough call

**Premium ($1,197) -- Total Overhaul**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- All workflows audited and rebuilt with proper trigger logic and error handling
- Custom reports and dashboards for sales, marketing, and operations
- Full data migration or cleanup (deduplication, field mapping, historical data repair)
- Integration fixes and reconnection (Zapier, native integrations, API connections)
- User permissions and role configuration
- Email template library setup
- 45-minute training call + recorded Loom walkthrough
- 14 days of post-delivery support
- Full written documentation

### Why Me
I have worked inside both HubSpot and Salesforce for years -- not as a certified partner trying to upsell you on a retainer, but as a CTO who actually uses these tools to run businesses. I know where both platforms break down, where the default settings fail you, and what configurations actually matter for a team that needs to close deals, not fiddle with settings.

I am the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I build and optimize production systems across CRM, automation, and analytics. You get someone who understands the architecture behind the platform, not just where to click.

### My Process
1. **Audit:** I log into your CRM, review every workflow, report, integration, and data structure. You get a written audit with every issue documented and prioritized -- not vague recommendations, but specific fixes.
2. **Build:** I rebuild workflows with proper logic, fix broken automations, configure reporting dashboards, and clean your data. You see progress in real time via shared access.
3. **Hand off:** I walk you through everything I changed, deliver documentation, and make sure your team knows how to maintain the system going forward. No black boxes.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Do you work with both HubSpot and Salesforce?**
   A: Yes. I have deep experience with both platforms. Tell me which one you are on and I will tailor the approach. If you are considering migrating between the two, I can advise on that as well.

2. **Q: My CRM is a mess -- is it worth fixing or should I start over?**
   A: Almost always worth fixing. Starting over means losing historical data and retraining your team. The Basic audit will tell you exactly what needs fixing and how bad it actually is. Most "messy" CRMs need 5-10 specific changes, not a full rebuild.

3. **Q: Can you build custom reports and dashboards?**
   A: Yes. Every Standard and Premium build includes custom reporting. I build dashboards that answer the questions your team actually asks -- pipeline velocity, conversion rates, revenue by source, rep activity. Not vanity metrics.

4. **Q: Will this disrupt my team's daily workflow?**
   A: No. I stage all changes and test before deploying. Workflow updates go live only after you review and approve them. Your team keeps working while I optimize behind the scenes.

5. **Q: Do you handle integrations with other tools?**
   A: Yes. I audit and fix integrations with tools like Zapier, Slack, QuickBooks, Mailchimp, Google Workspace, and custom APIs. Premium includes full integration repair. For Standard, I audit integrations and fix the critical ones.
