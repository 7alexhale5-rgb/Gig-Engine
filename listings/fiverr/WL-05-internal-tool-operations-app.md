## Gig Description

### Hook
Your team uses a combination of spreadsheets, email threads, shared drives, and sticky notes to manage an operational process that has outgrown all of them. The data is scattered, the process is manual, and every week someone drops the ball because the system is held together by tribal knowledge. You need a purpose-built tool that matches how your operations actually work — not another SaaS platform you have to bend your process around.

### What You Get

**Basic ($397) — Core Tool**
- 1 core module built around your primary operational workflow
- User authentication (login, signup, password reset)
- PostgreSQL database with proper schema design
- Clean data table views with sorting, filtering, and search
- Forms for data entry with validation
- Responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Deployed to Vercel + Supabase on a live URL
- Source code handoff with setup documentation

**Standard ($997) — Operations App**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- 3 feature modules covering your primary workflow areas
- Role-based access control (admin, manager, team member)

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. Internal tools are literally what I build for my own operations. I have built project management systems, equipment tracking apps, crew scheduling tools, client portals, and inventory systems — all custom, all production-grade, all still running. I know the difference between a tool that gets adopted and one that gets abandoned, and it comes down to matching the tool to how the team actually works.

### My Process
1. **Process mapping:** I map your current operational workflow — every step, every handoff, every decision point. I identify what should be automated, what needs a form, what needs a dashboard, and what can be eliminated. You approve the feature spec and wireframes before I write code.
2. **Build in sprints:** I develop in weekly sprints with a live staging link you can test. Your team provides feedback on real workflows, not mockups. We iterate until the tool fits your process.
3. **Deploy and adopt:** I deploy to production, migrate any existing data, train your team, and stay available for support to handle any issues that surface during real usage.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Can this replace a SaaS tool we are currently paying for?**
   A: Often, yes. If you are paying $50-500/month for a SaaS tool that only covers 60% of what you need, a custom internal tool can replace it entirely — with no per-seat fees and 100% of the features you actually use.

2. **Q: What technology do you use?**
   A: Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. A modern, well-documented stack that any competent developer can maintain. No vendor lock-in.

3. **Q: Can we add features after launch?**
   A: Yes. The codebase is modular and documented so adding new modules, fields, or integrations later is straightforward — either by me as a follow-up project or by your own developer.

4. **Q: How many users can it support?**
   A: No per-seat limits. The application handles 5 users or 500 users on the same infrastructure. Hosting costs are typically $0-25/month.

5. **Q: What if our operations are complex and do not fit a standard project scope?**
   A: That is exactly who this service is for. Message me with a description of your workflow and I will scope a custom project. I have built systems with 10+ modules — it just takes more time.

### CTA
Describe the operational process your team struggles with most — the one that relies on too many spreadsheets, emails, or manual coordination. I will tell you what the custom tool looks like and recommend the right scope.

## Requirements
- Description of the operational workflow(s) the tool needs to support
- Current tools and systems being used (spreadsheets, SaaS tools, manual processes)
- List of user roles and what each role needs to do
- Any existing data that needs to be migrated
- External tools that need integration (CRM, email, Slack, payment, etc.)
- Brand assets: logo, colors (optional for internal tools)
- Any compliance or security requirements
- Approximate number of users and expected data volume
