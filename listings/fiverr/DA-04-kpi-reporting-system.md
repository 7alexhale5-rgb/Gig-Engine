## Gig Description

### Hook
Your leadership team makes decisions based on numbers they cannot easily access. Someone spends half of every Monday morning pulling data from 4 different tools into a spreadsheet to produce a weekly report that is already out of date by the time it reaches the inbox. A KPI reporting system puts your most important metrics in one place, updates automatically, and tells you at a glance whether the business is on track — without anyone touching a spreadsheet.

### What You Get

**Basic ($247) — KPI Dashboard**
- Custom dashboard tracking 5-8 KPIs you define
- Data pulled from 1-2 sources (database, CRM, Google Sheets, API)
- Chart types: line graphs for trends, bar charts for comparisons, gauge indicators for goal tracking
- Color-coded status indicators: green (on target), yellow (watch), red (needs attention)
- Historical trend lines (last 30, 60, 90 days)
- Responsive design — works on desktop, tablet, and phone
- Deployed to a live URL your team can bookmark

**Standard ($597) — Reporting System**

- 15+ KPIs organized across multiple dashboard pages (by department, function, or time period)

- Date range selector and filters (team, region, product line)

- User authentication (team members log in to see their dashboards)
- 7 days of post-delivery support

**Premium ($1,197) — Executive Intelligence**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Automated insight generation: the system highlights notable changes, anomalies, and trends
- Threshold alerts: get notified when KPIs cross critical boundaries (via email, Slack, or SMS)
- Revenue and performance forecasting based on historical trends
- Board-ready PDF report generation (executive summary with charts, exportable on demand)
- Multi-level dashboards: executives see high-level summary, managers see department detail, teams see operational metrics

- 21 days of post-delivery support

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I build KPI systems for businesses where the numbers actually matter — where a CEO looks at a dashboard every morning before making decisions that affect dozens of employees and millions in revenue. I know the difference between a dashboard that gets used daily and one that gets forgotten: it comes down to showing the right metrics, with the right context, at the right level of detail for each audience.

### My Process
1. **KPI workshop:** I work with your leadership team to define exactly which metrics matter, where the data lives, and what thresholds indicate success or concern. I deliver a KPI specification document — every metric, its formula, its data source, and its target — for your approval.
2. **Build and integrate:** I build the dashboard system, connect your data sources, implement the calculations, and configure the visualizations. You get a staging link with your real data to review. I iterate until every number is verified and every chart tells the story clearly.
3. **Deploy and train:** I deploy the system, set up scheduled reports and alerts, configure user access, and walk your team through how to read and use the dashboards. Your leadership team starts their week with numbers they trust.

### FAQ
1. **Q: What data sources can you connect to?**
   A: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Google Sheets, Airtable, REST APIs, CSV files, and most SaaS tools with an API (HubSpot, Salesforce, Stripe, QuickBooks, Google Analytics, etc.). If your data has an API or a database, I can connect to it.

2. **Q: How current is the data on the dashboard?**
   A: It depends on the source. Direct database connections are near-real-time. API-based sources refresh on a schedule you choose (every 5 minutes, hourly, or daily). I configure the refresh cadence based on how current each KPI needs to be.

3. **Q: Can different people see different dashboards?**
   A: Yes. Standard and Premium tiers include user authentication. I configure role-based views so your CEO sees the executive summary, department heads see their team metrics, and individual contributors see their operational KPIs.

4. **Q: What technology do you use?**
   A: React with Recharts or Chart.js for the frontend, Next.js + Supabase for the backend and database. For simpler needs, I can build on Metabase or Retool. I recommend the tool that matches your team's technical ability and budget.

5. **Q: Can we add new KPIs later?**
   A: Yes. The system is built to be extensible — adding a new KPI is a configuration task, not a rebuild. I provide documentation so your team (or any developer) can add metrics without starting from scratch.

### CTA
