## Gig Description

### Hook
Leads come in and then nothing happens. Your sales team follows up with some of them, forgets about most of them, and nobody is nurturing the ones who are not ready to buy yet. Meanwhile your competitors are sending targeted sequences that keep them top of mind. Marketing automation fixes this permanently — every lead gets the right message at the right time based on what they do, not based on whether someone remembered to follow up.

### What You Get

**Basic ($197) — Nurture Flow**
- 1 automated lead nurture sequence (5-7 email/SMS touchpoints)
- Trigger setup: new lead, form submission, tag assignment, or pipeline stage change
- Basic personalization with merge fields (name, company, interest area)
- Timing optimization: messages spaced based on engagement best practices
- Unsubscribe handling and compliance (CAN-SPAM / GDPR)
- Deployed and tested in your CRM

**Standard ($497) — Automation Suite**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- 3 interconnected workflows:
  - **Nurture flow:** Warm up new leads with value-based content
  - **Re-engagement flow:** Win back leads that have gone cold
  - **Post-sale flow:** Onboarding, review requests, and upsell opportunities
- Conditional logic: different paths based on email opens, clicks, replies, and website visits
- Lead tagging automation: automatically categorize leads by interest and engagement level
- Internal notifications: alert your sales team when a lead hits key engagement thresholds
- Flow diagram documentation
- 7 days of post-delivery monitoring

**Premium ($997) — Marketing Engine**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Full lifecycle automation: prospect → MQL → SQL → customer → advocate
- Lead scoring: points accumulate based on engagement, demographics, and behavior
- Multi-channel flows: email, SMS, and webhook-triggered actions working together
- Dynamic content: different messaging based on lead segment, industry, or persona
- A/B testing on subject lines, send times, and content variations
- Campaign attribution: track which automations drive the most revenue
- Monthly performance reports (open rates, click rates, conversion rates, revenue impact)
- Integration with ad platforms for automated audience syncing
- Full documentation and training
- 14 days of post-delivery support

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I have built marketing automation systems for businesses where the sales cycle is long and the leads need nurturing — you do not close a $50K construction project on the first email. I understand the psychology of nurture sequences (providing value before asking for the sale) and the technical architecture (triggers, conditions, scoring, channel coordination). My automations are not templates with your logo slapped on — they are engineered around your specific buyer journey.

### My Process
1. **Journey mapping:** I map your customer lifecycle — how leads come in, what they care about at each stage, what motivates them to buy, and where they typically stall. I design the automation flows as visual diagrams with trigger conditions, timing, and content briefs for each touchpoint. You approve the strategy before I build.
2. **Build and connect:** I build the workflows in your CRM, configure triggers and conditions, set up tags and scoring, and integrate with your email/SMS platform. I write placeholder copy for each touchpoint (you can replace with your brand voice) and test every branch of the logic with real scenarios.
3. **Launch and optimize:** I activate the flows, monitor performance for the first week, and make adjustments based on initial data. You get a performance dashboard showing which sequences are working and where leads are dropping off.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Which platforms do you work with?**
   A: GoHighLevel, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Brevo, ConvertKit, and Drip. For SMS, I work with Twilio, GoHighLevel, and platform-native SMS tools. If your CRM has automation capabilities, I can build on it.

2. **Q: Do you write the email copy?**
   A: I write strategic placeholder copy for each touchpoint — subject lines, body structure, CTAs. You can use it as-is or replace it with your brand voice. For Premium tier, I include optimized copy based on your existing marketing materials and can A/B test variations.

3. **Q: How long should a nurture sequence be?**
   A: It depends on your sales cycle. B2B with a 3-month cycle? 12-15 touchpoints over 8-10 weeks. B2C with a short cycle? 5-7 touchpoints over 2 weeks. I design the sequence length based on your actual buyer journey, not a generic template.

4. **Q: Will this work if we only have a small list?**
   A: Yes. Marketing automation is not about volume — it is about consistency. Even with 100 leads, automated nurture ensures every single one gets followed up at the right time. The ROI actually increases with smaller teams because there are fewer people available for manual follow-up.

5. **Q: How do we know if the automations are working?**
   A: Every tier includes basic reporting. Standard and Premium include detailed analytics: open rates, click rates, conversion rates per sequence, and revenue attribution. I also set up A/B testing (Premium) so you can continuously improve performance.
