## Gig Description

### Hook
Your support team answers the same 20 questions over and over while complex issues pile up in the queue. An AI support bot handles the repetitive stuff instantly — password resets, order status, how-to questions — so your team focuses on problems that actually need a human. Most businesses can automate 50-70% of their support volume on day one.

### What You Get

**Basic ($197) — Auto-Reply Bot**
- AI chatbot trained on your support docs, FAQ, and help center articles
- Handles common questions with accurate, sourced answers
- Automatic escalation to human agent when the bot can't answer
- Website embed widget with your branding
- Up to 50 pages of support content indexed

**Standard ($497) — Smart Support**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Multi-channel deployment (website + email or Slack or WhatsApp)
- Automatic ticket classification — the bot tags and categorizes incoming issues
- Smart routing to the right team or agent based on issue type, priority, and skills
- Integration with your helpdesk (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, or HubSpot Service Hub)
- Canned response suggestions for agents on escalated tickets
- Up to 200 pages of support content indexed
- 7 days of post-launch tuning

**Premium ($997) — Full Support System**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- AI auto-replies on email and chat that resolve tickets without human involvement
- Sentiment detection that flags angry or urgent customers for immediate attention
- Priority scoring so your team sees the most critical issues first
- Customer context panel — the bot pulls order history, account status, and previous tickets so agents have full context on escalation
- Analytics dashboard showing resolution rates, average response time, bot accuracy, and top question categories
- Multi-language support (up to 5 languages)
- Full documentation and agent training walkthrough
- 14 days of optimization and support

### Why Me
I'm the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise — I build AI systems that handle real operational volume, not demo bots. My support bots use RAG to give answers grounded in your actual documentation, which means they don't make things up when they don't know. I've integrated with every major helpdesk platform and I understand support workflows from the inside. The bot I build will actually reduce your ticket volume, not just create a new channel for customers to get frustrated with.

### My Process
1. **Support audit:** I review your current support channels, top question categories, helpdesk setup, and resolution workflows. I identify which tickets are automatable and which need humans — you'll know the expected impact before I build anything.
2. **Build and train:** I build the bot, index your support content, configure ticket classification rules, and set up helpdesk integration. I test against real historical tickets to validate accuracy and routing logic.
3. **Deploy and optimize:** I launch the bot on your channels, monitor the first week of live interactions, and tune responses based on resolution rates and customer feedback. You get a bot that improves over time as I refine the knowledge base and routing rules.

### FAQ
1. **Q: What helpdesk platforms do you integrate with?**
   A: Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, HubSpot Service Hub, Help Scout, and any platform with an API. If you're using something else, message me first and I'll confirm compatibility.

2. **Q: Will the bot annoy my customers?**
   A: No. I design the bot to be helpful or get out of the way. If it can answer the question accurately, it does. If it can't, it escalates to a human immediately with full context — no loops, no "I didn't understand that" five times in a row. Customers can always request a human agent directly.

3. **Q: How does ticket classification work?**
   A: The AI reads incoming tickets and automatically tags them by category (billing, technical, how-to, account, etc.), assigns priority, and routes to the right team. It learns from your existing ticket history, so the categories match how your team already thinks about support issues.

4. **Q: Can the bot handle multiple languages?**
   A: The Premium tier supports up to 5 languages. The bot detects the customer's language and responds accordingly, pulling from language-specific knowledge base content where available. Basic and Standard tiers support English plus one additional language.

5. **Q: What's the typical resolution rate for the bot?**
   A: For most businesses with solid documentation, the bot resolves 40-60% of tickets without human intervention within the first month. That number climbs as we refine the knowledge base and add responses for edge cases. I'll give you a realistic estimate based on your specific support data during discovery.
