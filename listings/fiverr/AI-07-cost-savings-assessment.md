## Gig Description

### Hook
KPMG — one of the Big Four accounting firms — just forced their own auditor to cut fees 14% with one argument: AI makes this work cheaper now. That same logic applies to your SaaS subscriptions, per-seat licenses, and professional services contracts. The question is which ones and how much.

### What You Get

**Basic ($297) — Quick Scan**
- Review of your top 10 SaaS subscriptions and vendor contracts
- AI capability mapping for each: what can AI handle today vs. what genuinely requires the current solution
- Per-line-item savings estimate (conservative and aggressive scenarios)
- Negotiation talking points for your top 3 renegotiable vendors
- Delivered as a professional PDF report

**Standard ($997) — Full Assessment**
- Complete audit across all SaaS, per-seat licenses, and professional services contracts
- AI alternative mapping: for each cost center, the specific AI tools or agents that change the economics
- Dollar-figure savings report with current cost, AI-adjusted fair cost, and annual savings potential
- Vendor negotiation playbook with specific talking points and data for each renegotiable contract
- "Replace vs. renegotiate vs. keep" decision matrix for every line item
- 30-minute walkthrough call to review findings and prioritize next steps
- Delivered as a professional report + editable spreadsheet

**Premium ($2,497) — Assessment + Build**
- Everything in the Full Assessment
- Implementation of the highest-ROI AI replacement from the report (e.g., replace a per-seat review tool with a custom AI agent, automate a manual process that currently requires a vendor)
- Working, tested AI solution deployed in your environment
- Documentation and team training
- 30 days of post-deployment support
- You walk away with the savings roadmap and the first win already shipped

### Why Me
I'm a CTO who builds production AI systems every day. I don't just know what AI can theoretically do. I know what it actually does in production right now — which tools it replaces cleanly, which ones it can't touch, and where the real savings hide. My assessments are grounded in building experience, not slide decks. When I say a vendor is charging pre-AI prices, I can show you the AI alternative I'd build to prove it.

### My Process
1. **Intake:** You share your current SaaS subscriptions, vendor contracts, and professional services spend. I provide a structured intake form that takes about 20 minutes to complete. No guessing — I work from real numbers.
2. **Analysis:** I map every cost center against current AI capabilities. For each one, I determine: can AI fully replace this? Can AI reduce the workload enough to renegotiate the price? Or is this genuinely irreplaceable at its current cost? Every assessment includes specific dollar figures.
3. **Deliver:** You receive a savings report with per-line-item analysis, negotiation talking points, and a prioritized action plan. On Standard and Premium tiers, we do a live walkthrough so you leave knowing exactly what to do first.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Is this just telling me to cancel software and use ChatGPT instead?**
   A: No. Most of your SaaS stack exists for good reasons. The assessment identifies where the pricing no longer reflects the economics — not where you should rip out tools. Sometimes the answer is "renegotiate," sometimes it's "replace with an AI agent," and sometimes it's "this is fairly priced, keep it." You get all three categories.

2. **Q: How much do companies typically save?**
   A: It depends on the size of your vendor stack, but most assessments identify 15-30% savings across renegotiable contracts. One recent client found $4,200/month in addressable spend across 8 vendors. The Quick Scan alone usually identifies savings that cover the engagement cost within 30 days.

3. **Q: Do I need to be technical to use the results?**
   A: Not at all. The savings report is written for business owners and CFOs, not engineers. The negotiation talking points are ready to use in your next vendor call. If you choose the Premium tier, I handle the technical implementation myself.

4. **Q: What if my vendors push back on renegotiation?**
   A: The negotiation playbook includes specific data points and AI alternatives for each vendor. You're not asking for a discount — you're presenting evidence that the economics of their service have changed. The KPMG precedent shows this works even with the most established firms.

5. **Q: Can you also build the AI replacements you identify?**
   A: Yes. The Premium tier includes the first one. For the rest, I can build them as separate projects using the roadmap from the assessment. Every recommendation includes an implementation estimate so you know exactly what it takes.
