## Gig Description

### Hook
You have a website generating traffic and you cannot tell me which page converts best, where your leads drop off, or which ad campaign actually drives revenue. I set up analytics tracking that gives you real answers -- not a GA4 account with default settings and 47 metrics you never check.

### What You Get

**Basic ($197) -- Tracking Setup**
- GA4 or Mixpanel setup configured for your specific business
- Up to 10 custom event definitions (button clicks, form submissions, page scrolls, video plays)
- Conversion tracking for your key actions (purchase, sign-up, booking, lead form)
- Google Tag Manager configuration with clean container structure
- Basic reporting dashboard showing the metrics that matter
- Tracking verification and QA testing

**Standard ($497) -- Full Analytics Stack**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Multi-platform tracking (GA4 + Mixpanel, or GA4 + Facebook Pixel + Google Ads)
- Up to 25 custom events across your entire user journey
- Funnel analysis setup (see exactly where users drop off)
- UTM parameter strategy and campaign tracking framework
- Custom reporting dashboard with real-time data
- Enhanced e-commerce or lead gen tracking (depending on your model)
- 30-minute walkthrough call

**Premium ($997) -- Analytics Engine**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Unlimited custom events with structured naming convention
- Server-side tracking (first-party data collection that survives ad blockers)
- Custom data pipeline: events flow into your own database for advanced analysis
- Real-time dashboards with alerting (get notified when conversion rates drop)
- Cross-domain tracking setup
- Data layer implementation for complex SPAs or multi-step flows
- Audience segmentation and cohort definitions
- Full documentation with event dictionary
- 45-minute strategy + training call
- 14 days of post-delivery monitoring and support

### Why Me
I have set up analytics for SaaS products, e-commerce stores, lead gen sites, and multi-page marketing funnels. The difference is that I understand the data model behind the tracking, not just where to paste a script tag. When I set up your events, they are named consistently, structured for analysis, and actually tied to the business questions you need answered.

I am a CTO and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I build production web applications daily, which means I understand how tracking needs to work inside real codebases -- SPAs, server-rendered pages, dynamic forms, and third-party embeds. Your analytics setup will not break the next time your site gets updated.

### My Process
1. **Audit & plan:** I review your current tracking setup (or lack of one), identify the business questions you need answered, and define every event and conversion point. You approve the tracking plan before implementation starts.
2. **Implement & verify:** I set up your tracking platform, configure GTM, implement custom events, and build your reporting dashboard. Every event is QA-tested with real data to verify it fires correctly.
3. **Document & train:** I deliver a complete event dictionary, a reporting walkthrough, and make sure your team knows how to read the data and act on it. Analytics that nobody understands are just noise.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Should I use GA4 or Mixpanel?**
   A: GA4 is free and solid for most businesses -- especially if you run Google Ads. Mixpanel is better for product analytics (SaaS, apps) where you need to track user behavior over time. I will recommend the right tool based on your business model during our kickoff.

2. **Q: My GA4 is set up but I do not trust the data. Can you fix it?**
   A: Yes. This is actually the most common request I get. Most GA4 setups have duplicate events, missing conversions, or filters that exclude real traffic. I audit your existing setup, fix what is broken, and fill in what is missing.

3. **Q: Will tracking slow down my website?**
   A: No. I implement tracking through Google Tag Manager with proper trigger timing so scripts load after your page content. Premium includes server-side tracking which has zero impact on page load speed.

4. **Q: Can you track events inside my web app (not just page views)?**
   A: Yes. Button clicks, form submissions, scroll depth, video engagement, file downloads, in-app actions -- anything a user does can be tracked as a custom event. This is where analytics gets useful. Page views alone tell you almost nothing.

5. **Q: What about privacy and GDPR compliance?**
   A: I implement tracking with consent management in mind. If you need a cookie consent banner, I can configure one. Server-side tracking (Premium) gives you first-party data collection that respects privacy regulations while still giving you the data you need.

Send me your website URL and tell me the one question about your visitors you cannot currently answer -- I will audit your tracking and tell you what is missing.
