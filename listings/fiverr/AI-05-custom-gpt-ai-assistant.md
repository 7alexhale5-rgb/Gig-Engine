## Gig Description

### Hook
You have seen what ChatGPT can do and you want that power focused on your specific business — answering questions from your documentation, following your processes, speaking in your brand voice. A generic AI gives generic answers. A custom GPT trained on your content gives answers that sound like your best employee on their best day. I build custom GPTs and AI assistants that know your business, follow your rules, and integrate with your tools.

### What You Get

**Basic ($147) — Custom GPT**
- Custom GPT created in ChatGPT with tailored system instructions
- Up to 10 knowledge files uploaded (PDFs, docs, spreadsheets — your SOPs, FAQs, product info)
- Conversation starters configured for your most common use cases
- Prompt engineering to control tone, accuracy, and response format
- Testing and refinement to ensure accurate responses
- Setup guide for sharing with your team via ChatGPT Teams or Enterprise

**Standard ($397) — AI Assistant**
- Everything in Basic, plus:
- Built on OpenAI Assistants API for programmatic access
- Larger knowledge base (up to 50 documents)
- Function calling: the assistant can pull live data from your systems (CRM, database, APIs)
- Web-embeddable chat widget for your website or internal portal
- Conversation memory and thread management
- Custom response formatting (markdown, structured data, action items)
- Basic usage logging
- 7 days of post-delivery support

**Premium ($897) — AI Platform**
- Everything in Standard, plus:
- Multiple tool integrations (CRM lookup, database queries, email sending, calendar scheduling)
- Admin panel to manage knowledge base, view conversations, and adjust behavior without code changes
- Usage analytics: conversation volume, common questions, response quality metrics
- A/B testing for different prompt strategies
- Rate limiting and cost controls
- API endpoints for integration with your other applications
- Fallback handling: graceful escalation to human when the AI cannot answer
- Full documentation and prompt engineering guide
- 21 days of post-delivery support with tuning

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I build AI assistants that actually get used — not demos that impress in a meeting and collect dust afterward. My own company runs on custom GPTs: one handles project documentation queries, another assists with estimating, and a third manages our internal knowledge base. I understand the prompt engineering, knowledge architecture, and integration work required to make an AI assistant genuinely useful in a business context.

### My Process
1. **Knowledge audit:** I review your content — SOPs, FAQs, product docs, internal guides — and identify what the AI needs to know. I define the assistant's personality, boundaries (what it should and should not answer), and response format. You approve the behavior spec before I build.
2. **Build and train:** I configure the custom GPT or Assistants API implementation, upload and index your knowledge base, engineer the prompts, and set up any integrations. I test with real questions from your team to validate accuracy and catch edge cases.
3. **Deploy and refine:** I deploy the assistant to your chosen platform (ChatGPT, website widget, API, or Slack), train your team on how to use it, and provide a 1-2 week tuning period where I adjust prompts based on real usage patterns.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Custom GPT in ChatGPT vs. Assistants API — what is the difference?**
   A: A Custom GPT lives inside ChatGPT and is the simplest option — great for internal team use if everyone has ChatGPT Plus/Teams. The Assistants API is a developer tool that lets me embed the assistant in your website, app, or integrate it with other systems. Basic tier uses Custom GPT; Standard and Premium use the API.

2. **Q: How accurate will the responses be?**
   A: With proper knowledge files and prompt engineering, custom GPTs are highly accurate for questions within their knowledge domain. I configure guardrails so the assistant says "I don't know" rather than hallucinating when a question falls outside its training. Accuracy improves during the tuning period as we identify and fix edge cases.

3. **Q: Can the AI assistant access our live data?**
   A: Yes, in Standard and Premium tiers. Using function calling, the assistant can query your CRM, database, or any system with an API in real time. For example, a customer can ask "What is the status of my order?" and the assistant pulls the live answer from your database.

4. **Q: What about data privacy?**
   A: Your knowledge files are processed through OpenAI's API with their data usage policies (they do not train on API data). For sensitive data, I can implement additional controls: data masking, access restrictions, and audit logging. If you need fully private AI, I can discuss self-hosted alternatives.

5. **Q: How much does it cost to run after you build it?**
   A: Custom GPTs in ChatGPT are included in your ChatGPT subscription ($25-30/user/month). API-based assistants cost based on usage — typically $0.01-0.10 per conversation depending on length and model. I configure cost controls so you never get surprised by a bill.

## Requirements
- Description of what the AI assistant should do (answer questions, assist with tasks, guide processes)
- Knowledge files: SOPs, FAQs, product documentation, internal guides (any format)
- Example questions and ideal answers (5-10 examples help me calibrate the prompts)
- Desired tone and personality (formal, casual, technical, friendly)
- Any topics the AI should NOT discuss or areas where it should defer to a human
- Integration requirements (website embed, Slack, API, etc.)
- For Premium: list of systems the AI should be able to query or interact with
