## Gig Description

### Hook

You're paying $50-200/seat/month for SaaS tools that your team barely uses at full capacity. Meanwhile, AI agents can do the same work without logins, without seats, and without the annual price hike email from your vendor.

The SaaS model is breaking. Only 14% of enterprises have moved to agentic AI. The other 86% are still bleeding per-seat costs while their competitors build agents that work around the clock. I'll show you exactly which tools to replace and how to architect the transition without blowing up your operations.

### What You Get

**Basic ($397) — Transition Blueprint**
- Audit of every per-seat SaaS tool in your stack
- Scored replacement matrix (feasibility, impact, risk)
- Agent architecture diagrams for top candidates
- Phased migration plan with timelines and dependencies
- ROI projection with real cost-per-agent vs. cost-per-seat numbers

**Standard ($1,297) — Blueprint + First Agent**
- Everything in the Transition Blueprint
- Production deployment of your highest-impact AI agent
- Full source code, tests, and documentation
- Integration with your existing systems of record
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- 1-week post-deploy support window

**Premium ($3,497) — Full Agentic Transition**
- Everything in Standard
- Up to 5 AI agents built and deployed
- Data migration from replaced SaaS tools
- 2 team training sessions (recorded)
- 30 days of post-deployment support
- Architecture decision records for future agents

### Why Me

I'm a CTO who builds production AI systems every single day — not proofs of concept, not demos, real systems handling real business operations. I've architected agent systems that replaced per-seat tools for CRM, customer support, document processing, and lead qualification workflows. I also serve as CTO for an enterprise construction company, so I understand the operational reality of ripping out tools that teams depend on. This isn't about being bleeding edge. It's about being practical: keep your systems of record (your database, your data platform), replace the expensive per-seat interfaces with agents that are faster, cheaper, and always available.

### My Process

1. **Audit & Score** — I map your entire SaaS stack, identify per-seat costs, usage patterns, and integration points. Every tool gets a replacement feasibility score.
2. **Architect** — I design the agent architecture: what each agent does, what APIs it calls, where data flows, how it integrates with what you're keeping. No hand-waving — real diagrams and specs.
3. **Build & Deploy** — For Standard and Premium tiers, I build production agents with proper error handling, monitoring, and documentation. You get working software, not a slide deck.
4. **Validate & Train** — I verify everything works with your real data, train your team on managing the agents, and stick around to make sure the transition sticks.

### FAQ

1. **Q: Will this break our existing workflows?**
   A: No. The blueprint specifically identifies dependencies and migration order. We keep your systems of record intact — I'm replacing the per-seat interface layer, not your data. The phased approach means you can run old and new in parallel during transition.

2. **Q: What types of SaaS tools can be replaced with agents?**
   A: The best candidates are tools where humans log in to do repetitive work: CRM data entry, customer support triage, document processing, report generation, lead qualification, scheduling, and notification management. Tools that are pure data storage (your database, your data warehouse) stay.

3. **Q: What tech stack do you use for the agents?**
   A: It depends on your infrastructure, but typically: TypeScript/Python for agent logic, Claude or GPT-4 for reasoning, your existing database as the system of record, and n8n or custom orchestration for workflow management. Everything is self-hosted or on your cloud — no third-party agent platforms that become the next per-seat cost.

4. **Q: How much can we actually save?**
   A: Typical per-seat SaaS costs run $50-200/user/month. An agent replacing that function costs $5-20/month in compute and API calls with no per-seat scaling. For a 50-person team using 3-4 per-seat tools, the math usually works out to 60-80% cost reduction within 6 months.

5. **Q: Do we need a technical team to maintain the agents after you leave?**
   A: The agents are built to be low-maintenance with monitoring and alerting built in. For Premium tier, I train your team on management and troubleshooting. That said, you should have at least one technical person who can read logs and restart services. I document everything so even a junior developer can maintain the system.

### CTA

Message me before ordering. I need to understand your current stack, team size, and which pain points are driving this before I can confirm the right tier. A 15-minute scoping call saves us both time and makes sure you get exactly what you need.

## Requirements

- List of your current SaaS tools with per-seat pricing
- Team size and roles — how many seats you're paying for and what each role does in each tool
- Current pain points — which tools are the most frustrating, most expensive, or most underutilized
- Technical environment — cloud provider, hosting situation, whether you have a technical team
- Timeline and budget constraints
