## Gig Description

### Hook
You're paying for Zapier but your zaps are basic single-step connections that barely scratch the surface. The real power is in multi-step zaps with filters, paths, formatters, and webhooks — the stuff that actually replaces a full-time data entry person. I build Zapier automations that handle real business logic, not just "trigger happens, action fires."

### What You Get

**Basic ($97) — Single Zap**
- 1 multi-step zap connecting 2-3 apps
- Filter and path logic so the zap only fires when it should
- Data formatting and field mapping between systems
- Testing with your live data
- Setup documentation with trigger/action breakdown

**Standard ($247) — Automation Suite**
- 3 interconnected zaps that work as a unified system
- Conditional paths — different outcomes based on data values
- Formatter steps for dates, text, numbers, and lookups
- Error handling with Slack or email notifications on failure
- Full documentation with workflow diagrams
- 7 days of post-delivery monitoring

**Premium ($597) — Full Workflow System**
- 5+ zaps forming a complete automation system
- Webhook triggers for real-time event-driven flows
- Multi-step data transformations and cross-zap dependencies
- Zapier Tables or Storage for stateful workflows
- Conditional branching, delays, and scheduled triggers
- Error routing and failure alerting
- Full documentation with architecture overview
- 14 days of post-delivery support and tuning

### Why Me
I'm the founder of PrettyFly.ai and I've been building automation systems for over a decade — Zapier, n8n, Make, custom code, all of it. I know when a visual builder is the right call and when you need something else entirely. Most Zapier "experts" give you single-step zaps that a YouTube tutorial could teach you. I build multi-step systems with real conditional logic, data transformation, and error handling that actually replace manual work. I'll also tell you honestly if Zapier isn't the right tool for what you need.

### My Process
1. **Scope your workflow:** We walk through what you're doing manually today, which apps are involved, and what the automation should do. I map the data flow and confirm Zapier can handle it properly.
2. **Build and test:** I build each zap with filters, formatters, and paths — then test against your real data until every edge case is handled. No dummy data demos.
3. **Deploy and hand off:** I activate everything in your Zapier account, verify it runs correctly in production, and give you documentation so you can manage it going forward.

### FAQ
1. **Q: I already have basic zaps — can you upgrade them?**
   A: Yes. I audit your existing zaps, identify where they're fragile or missing logic, and rebuild them with proper filters, error handling, and paths. Most clients see a 50%+ reduction in zap failures after I clean things up.

2. **Q: What Zapier plan do I need?**
   A: Basic tier works on any paid Zapier plan. Standard and Premium tiers use multi-step zaps and paths, which require Zapier Professional or higher. I'll confirm your plan covers what we need during the scope call.

3. **Q: Can you connect apps that don't have a Zapier integration?**
   A: If the app has an API or supports webhooks, yes — I use Zapier's Webhooks by Zapier and Code by Zapier steps to connect systems that don't have native integrations. If neither option works, I'll recommend an alternative approach.

4. **Q: What if my zap stops working after delivery?**
   A: Standard includes 7 days and Premium includes 14 days of monitoring. During that window, I fix anything that breaks at no extra cost. The documentation I provide also covers common troubleshooting steps so your team can handle routine issues.

5. **Q: Should I use Zapier or n8n/Make instead?**
   A: Zapier is great when you want cloud-hosted, zero-maintenance automation and you're okay with per-task pricing. If you have high volume or need self-hosted control, n8n or Make might be better. I'll give you an honest recommendation — I build on all three platforms.

Tell me which apps you need connected and what manual process you want to eliminate. I'll scope it in 24 hours and tell you exactly which tier fits — no pressure, no upsell.

## Requirements
- Access to your Zapier account (or willingness to create one)
- List of apps/systems you want connected
- Description of the manual process you want automated (bullet points or a screen recording both work)
- Any specific triggers, schedules, or conditions the workflow should follow
- Your current Zapier plan (so I can confirm feature availability)
