## Gig Description

### Hook
You have products ready to sell but your online presence is either nonexistent or stuck on a generic template that looks like every other store in your niche. A slow, cluttered store does not just look bad — it actively kills conversions. Every extra second of load time drops your conversion rate by 7%. I build e-commerce storefronts that load fast, look professional, and are engineered to turn visitors into buyers.

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. While my primary work is in business software and AI, I have built e-commerce storefronts for product businesses that need speed and conversion — not just a pretty template. My approach is performance-first: every store I build loads in under 2 seconds, is mobile-optimized, and has the conversion elements (trust signals, clear CTAs, fast checkout) that turn browsers into buyers.

### My Process
1. **Product and brand review:** I review your product catalog, brand assets, and target market. I map out the store structure — collections, navigation, and checkout flow — and present a layout for your approval before building.
2. **Build and populate:** I build the storefront, upload your product data (images, descriptions, pricing, variants), configure payments and shipping, and optimize every page for speed and mobile. You get a preview link to review and request changes.
3. **Launch and verify:** I connect your domain, run checkout tests with real payment processing, verify all analytics tracking fires correctly, and hand over store admin credentials with a management guide.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Shopify or custom build — which should I choose?**
   A: Shopify if you want a managed platform with a large app ecosystem and are okay with monthly fees ($39-399/month). Custom (Next.js + Stripe) if you want full control, no monthly platform fees, and maximum performance. I will recommend the right option during our initial review.

2. **Q: Can I manage the store myself after launch?**
   A: Yes. Shopify has a user-friendly admin panel. For custom builds, I set up a content management interface so you can add products, update prices, and manage inventory without touching code.

3. **Q: Do you handle product photography or copywriting?**
   A: I do not provide photography, but I optimize your existing images for web (compression, sizing, alt tags). For product descriptions, I can write conversion-focused copy based on your product details for an additional fee, or structure descriptions from content you provide.

4. **Q: What about ongoing costs?**
   A: Shopify: $39-399/month plus payment processing (2.4-2.9% + $0.30). Custom build: $0-20/month hosting plus Stripe processing (2.9% + $0.30). I break down the full cost picture during our initial review.

5. **Q: Can you integrate with my fulfillment or inventory system?**
   A: Yes. Shopify integrates with most fulfillment services (ShipStation, ShipBob, Amazon FBA). Custom builds can integrate with any system that has an API. Let me know your specific provider and I will confirm compatibility.
