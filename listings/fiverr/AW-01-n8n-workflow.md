## Gig Description

### Hook
That manual data entry between your apps is costing you 10-20 hours a week. Every CSV export, every copy-paste, every "I will update the other system later" -- that is time your team could spend on work that actually grows the business. I eliminate it with a visual, no-code workflow you can see and manage yourself -- no developer required after handoff.

### What You Get

**Basic ($47) — Starter Workflow**
- 1 automated workflow connecting 2 systems (e.g., form submission to CRM, new order to Slack)
- Trigger + action configuration and testing
- Basic deployment and activation

**Standard ($297) — Production Workflow**
- Multi-step workflow with branching logic and conditional paths
- Error handling and automatic retry on failure
- Data transformation and field mapping between systems
- Full documentation with workflow diagram
- 7 days of post-delivery monitoring

**Premium ($797) — Enterprise Automation**
- Complex automation spanning 3-5 systems
- Webhook endpoints, scheduled triggers, and event-driven flows
- Dashboard for monitoring workflow health and run history
- Alerting on failures (email/Slack notifications)
- Full documentation with architecture overview
- 14 days of post-delivery support and tuning

### Why Me
I am the CTO of a construction enterprise and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I specialize in no-code and low-code automation platforms -- n8n and Make are my primary tools. Unlike fragile point-and-click flows that break on the first edge case, I build production-grade visual workflows with proper error handling, logging, and monitoring from day one. Self-hosted n8n means zero per-task fees -- you own your automation infrastructure outright. I use AI-powered development to deliver faster without cutting corners.

### My Process
1. **Discovery call (15 min):** I map out your current manual process, identify the systems involved, and define exactly what the automation should do.
2. **Build and test:** I build the workflow in n8n or Make with proper error handling, test it against real data, and iterate until it runs clean.
3. **Deploy and document:** I activate the workflow in your environment, walk you through how it works, and hand over documentation so your team is never locked in.

### FAQ
1. **Q: Should I use n8n or Make?**
   A: It depends on your setup. n8n is self-hosted and gives you full control with no per-execution fees — great for high-volume workflows. Make is cloud-hosted and easier for non-technical teams to maintain. I will recommend the best fit during our discovery call.

2. **Q: What apps and systems can you connect?**
   A: Nearly anything with an API. Common integrations include CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, GHL), email platforms (Mailchimp, SendGrid), payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), project tools (Notion, Asana, Monday), spreadsheets (Google Sheets, Airtable), and hundreds more.

3. **Q: Will my workflow break if an API changes?**
   A: I build with resilience in mind. Standard and Premium tiers include error handling and retry logic. Premium also includes monitoring and alerting so you know immediately if something needs attention.

4. **Q: Do I need to host anything myself?**
   A: For Make workflows, no — everything runs in the cloud. For n8n, you will need a server (I can set this up for you or use your existing infrastructure). I will advise on the best approach during discovery.

5. **Q: Can you automate something more complex than what is listed here?**
   A: Absolutely. The tiers are starting points. Message me with your specific use case and I will scope a custom solution. If it involves APIs, data, or business logic, I can automate it.

### CTA
Drop me a message with the two apps you need connected and what should happen between them -- I will tell you which package fits and how fast I can deliver.

## Requirements
- Access to the systems/apps you want to connect (login credentials or API keys)
- A clear description of the manual process you want automated (or a quick screen recording)
- Preferred platform if you have one (n8n or Make), otherwise I will recommend
- For n8n: server/hosting details if self-hosting, or confirmation you want cloud-hosted
- Any specific triggers, schedules, or conditions the workflow should follow
