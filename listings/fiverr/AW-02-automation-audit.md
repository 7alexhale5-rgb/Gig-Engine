## Gig Description

### Hook
You know there are tasks in your business that should not require a human — but you are not sure where to start automating or what the payoff would be. Without a clear roadmap, most businesses either automate the wrong things first or spend months researching tools instead of shipping solutions.

### What You Get

**Basic ($127) — Department Audit**
- Deep-dive into 1 department or business function (e.g., sales, onboarding, fulfillment)
- Visual process map of current workflows (as-is state)
- Identification of top 3-5 automation opportunities ranked by impact
- Tool recommendations for each opportunity
- Delivered as a professional PDF report

**Standard ($497) — Full Business Audit**
- Comprehensive audit across all major business functions
- Visual process maps for each department (as-is state)
- Prioritized automation roadmap with timeline and dependencies
- ROI projections for each automation opportunity (time saved, cost reduction, error elimination)

### Why Me
I am a CTO who has led automation strategy for an enterprise construction company and built PrettyFly.ai from the ground up. I do not just identify what could be automated — I understand the business case behind each decision. My audits are grounded in real implementation experience across CRMs, APIs, AI tools, and workflow platforms. You get a roadmap from someone who actually builds the systems, not a consultant who hands you a slide deck and walks away.

### My Process
1. **Intake questionnaire + kickoff call:** I learn how your business operates today — the tools you use, the pain points your team faces, and where time is being lost. I ask targeted questions to uncover the processes that matter most.
2. **Audit and analysis:** I map your current workflows, evaluate your tech stack, identify bottlenecks, and score each automation opportunity on impact, feasibility, and ROI. No fluff — just actionable findings.
3. **Deliver and walkthrough:** You receive a professional report with clear process maps, a prioritized roadmap, and ROI projections. On the Standard and Premium tiers, we do a live walkthrough so you leave with full clarity on next steps.

### FAQ
1. **Q: What kind of businesses is this audit designed for?**
   A: Any business running on 3+ software tools with manual processes connecting them. I have audited agencies, e-commerce operations, professional services firms, construction companies, and SaaS startups. If your team is doing repetitive work that feels like it should be automated, this audit is for you.

2. **Q: How much time will I need to invest in this process?**
   A: About 30-45 minutes for the intake questionnaire and kickoff call. After that, I do the heavy lifting. If I need clarification on specific workflows, I may send a few follow-up questions via message.

3. **Q: Will you actually build the automations, or just recommend them?**
   A: The Basic and Standard tiers deliver strategy and recommendations. The Premium tier includes implementation of the top automation. For everything else on the roadmap, I can build those as separate projects — or your team can use the roadmap to implement with any developer.

4. **Q: What tools and platforms do you typically recommend?**
   A: It depends entirely on your existing stack and budget. Common recommendations include n8n, Make (Integromat), Zapier, GoHighLevel, HubSpot, custom API integrations, and AI-powered tools. I am platform-agnostic — I recommend what fits your situation, not what pays me a referral fee.

5. **Q: What is the typical ROI from an automation audit?**
   A: Most clients identify 15-30 hours per week of recoverable time across their team within the first round of implementation. On the Premium tier, the first automation alone typically pays for the entire engagement within 4-8 weeks through time savings or error reduction.
