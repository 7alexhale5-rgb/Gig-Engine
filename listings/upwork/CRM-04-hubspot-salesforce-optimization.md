## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline

HubSpot & Salesforce CRM Optimization | Workflows | Reporting | Data Cleanup (72 chars)

### Overview

Your CRM has thousands of contacts and your team still cannot pull a reliable report. I fix that. I optimize HubSpot and Salesforce instances that have been neglected, misconfigured, or outgrown their original setup -- workflows, reporting, data hygiene, and integrations.

Most CRM problems are not platform problems. They are configuration problems. Default workflows that never got customized. Lead scoring that was set up once and never tuned. Reports that measure the wrong things. Integrations that quietly stopped syncing six months ago. I audit everything, document every issue, and fix them in priority order so your team sees results fast.

I serve as CTO for an enterprise and I am the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I have used both HubSpot and Salesforce in production environments -- not just as a consultant poking around a sandbox. That means I understand how these tools need to work for real sales teams, not just how they look in a demo.

**What I deliver:**
- Full CRM audit with prioritized issue report
- Workflow automation builds and repairs
- Custom reporting dashboards (pipeline, revenue, activity)
- Data hygiene: deduplication, field cleanup, standardization
- Lead scoring optimization
- Integration audit and repair
- Documentation + training walkthrough

## Service Description

A CRM that cannot answer "how many deals did we close last month" is not a CRM -- it is a contact list. I specialize in fixing HubSpot and Salesforce instances that have drifted from useful tool to expensive address book.

My process starts with a full audit: every workflow, every report, every integration, every custom field. I document what is broken, what is missing, and what is wasting your team's time. Then I fix it in priority order -- the stuff that is costing you deals gets fixed first. Workflows get rebuilt with proper trigger logic. Reports get reconfigured to show the numbers your leadership team actually needs. Data gets cleaned so your pipeline numbers are trustworthy.

I have optimized CRM instances for sales teams ranging from 3 reps to 50+. Whether your HubSpot has been neglected for two years or your Salesforce was set up by someone who left the company, I can get it back to a state where your team trusts the data and your leadership trusts the reports.

Every engagement ends with documentation and a training walkthrough. I do not create a dependency -- I make sure your team can maintain what I built.

### Hook

Your [HubSpot/Salesforce] instance sounds like it needs a proper audit and optimization pass -- not just a quick fix, but a systematic review of what is broken and why. That is exactly what I do.

### Credibility

I have optimized CRM instances for sales teams across [RELEVANT INDUSTRIES]. I work inside both HubSpot and Salesforce regularly, and I serve as CTO for an enterprise -- so I understand how CRMs need to work for real teams, not just in theory.

### Approach

- Configure custom reporting dashboards and clean up data (Day 8-12)
- Documentation + training walkthrough (Day 12-14)

### Differentiator

### CTA

Happy to start with a quick audit call. I can scope the full project in 15 minutes and have an action plan to you within 48 hours.
