## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline

Client Portal MVP -- Next.js, Supabase, Auth, Dashboard, Admin (60 chars)

### Overview

Full custom client portal: authentication, dashboard, CRUD, file uploads, notifications, and admin panel. Built in Next.js + Supabase -- production-ready, not a prototype. Deployed to your domain, no per-seat SaaS fees.

I build client portals as real web applications -- not cobbled-together no-code tools with monthly fees. My stack is Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. You get a production-grade portal your clients log into, see their data, upload files, receive notifications, and interact with your team -- all under your brand on your domain.

This is the highest-value service I offer because it replaces 3-5 SaaS subscriptions with a single custom application you own. No per-seat licensing. No feature limitations. No vendor lock-in. Your portal grows with your business because you control the code.

**What I deliver:**
- User authentication (email/password, magic link, or SSO)
- Client-facing dashboard with real-time data
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete records)
- File upload and document management
- Email/in-app notification system
- Admin panel for internal team management
- Role-based access control
- Mobile-responsive design
- Full source code + deployment + documentation

## Service Description

Most businesses reach a point where spreadsheets, shared drives, and email threads can't support client communication anymore. A client portal solves that -- one place where clients log in, see their project status, upload documents, and communicate with your team. But off-the-shelf portals charge per seat, limit customization, and eventually force you into an expensive migration when you outgrow them.

I build custom client portals from scratch using Next.js and Supabase. The result is a full web application deployed to your domain: authentication, dashboards, file management, notifications, and an admin panel for your team. Every portal is built with TypeScript for type safety, Row Level Security for data isolation between clients, and responsive design for mobile access.

My background as CTO for a construction enterprise means I've architected portals that handle real operational complexity -- not just toy demos. Whether you need a simple client dashboard or a full-featured portal with workflows, approvals, and integrations, I scope it properly, build it right, and deliver production-ready code with documentation.

### Hook

You need a place where clients log in, see their data, upload documents, and communicate with your team -- without paying per-seat SaaS fees forever. I build exactly that.

### Credibility

I have architected and built production client portals handling real operational complexity -- authentication, role-based access, file management, and admin panels -- as CTO for a construction enterprise.

### Approach

- Define user roles, data model, and core workflows with you (Day 1-3)
- Build authentication, database schema, and API layer (Day 4-8)
- Build client-facing dashboard, CRUD operations, and file uploads (Day 8-16)
- Build admin panel, notifications, deploy to your domain (Day 16-21)
- Testing, documentation, and walkthrough (Day 21-25)

### Differentiator

This is a full custom build -- Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript -- not a no-code tool with monthly fees. You own the code, the data, and the infrastructure. CTO-level architecture at freelance pricing.
