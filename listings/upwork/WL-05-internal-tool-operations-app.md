# Internal Tool / Operations App — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
Internal Tools & Operations Apps | Next.js | Supabase | Custom Business Software

### Overview
I build custom internal tools and operations applications that replace the patchwork of spreadsheets, email threads, and SaaS tools your team currently uses to manage operational processes. Purpose-built software that matches how your business actually works — not another platform you have to bend your process around.

Every operations team reaches a point where generic tools cannot keep up. Your project tracker lives in Monday.com but your resource allocation is in a spreadsheet and your client communication is in email and your billing is in QuickBooks and nothing talks to anything else. A custom operations app unifies the data, automates the handoffs, and gives your team one place to manage the entire workflow.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise, internal tools are literally what I build for my own operations. I have built project management systems, equipment tracking apps, crew scheduling tools, client portals, and inventory systems — all custom, all production-grade, all still running. I use Next.js 14, Supabase, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS — a modern, maintainable stack with no vendor lock-in.

## Service Description

Custom internal tools solve a specific problem: your operational process does not fit neatly into any existing SaaS product, so your team uses 4 different tools plus spreadsheets to manage it. The data is fragmented, the process has manual handoffs that get dropped, and onboarding a new team member takes weeks because the system is held together by tribal knowledge.

I build operations applications that consolidate your workflow into a single tool. The approach is process-first: I map your current workflow (every step, every handoff, every decision point), identify what should be automated, what needs a form, what needs a dashboard, and what can be eliminated. Then I build the application around your process, not the other way around.

The technology stack is Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. No proprietary frameworks, no vendor lock-in, no per-seat fees. A developer on your team can maintain and extend it using standard web development skills. Hosting costs are typically $0-25/month on Vercel + Supabase free tiers.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You need a custom [TOOL TYPE] that handles [CORE WORKFLOW] for your team of [SIZE]. I build exactly this type of internal tool and can have a working first version within [TIMELINE].

### Credibility
I built an operations platform for a construction company that unified project tracking, crew scheduling, and equipment management into a single application — replacing 3 separate SaaS subscriptions ($800/month) with a custom tool that does exactly what the team needs.

### Approach
- Process mapping: document current workflow, identify automation opportunities, approve feature spec (Day 1-4)
- Sprint 1: core module — database schema, auth, primary data views and forms (Day 5-11)
- Sprint 2: additional modules — integrations, notifications, role-based access (Day 12-18)
- Sprint 3: polish — dashboard, reporting, mobile optimization, testing (Day 19-24)
- Deploy, migrate data, train team, begin support period (Day 25-28)

### Differentiator
I build internal tools for my own company, so I know the difference between a tool that gets adopted and one that gets abandoned. It comes down to matching the tool to how the team actually works — not building a generic CRUD app and hoping people adapt. Every module I build is designed around a specific workflow with real user input.

### CTA
Describe the operational process your team struggles with most — I will outline what the custom tool looks like and give you a fixed-price estimate within 24 hours.
