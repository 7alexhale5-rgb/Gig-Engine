# CRM Reporting & Dashboard Setup — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
CRM Reporting & Dashboards | Sales Analytics | Pipeline Metrics

### Overview
I build custom CRM reports and dashboards that surface the sales metrics your team needs to make decisions. Pipeline conversion rates, deal velocity, lead source attribution, team performance — the numbers your CRM has but nobody can easily access without exporting to Excel.

Every sales team has the same problem: the CRM has data, but getting useful reports requires manual extraction and spreadsheet gymnastics. Your sales manager wants a pipeline forecast, your CEO wants revenue trends, and your marketing team wants to know which channels produce actual customers. I build the reports and dashboards that answer these questions automatically, inside your CRM or as a standalone analytics layer.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise, I build reporting systems for businesses where pipeline metrics directly drive decisions. I work with HubSpot, Salesforce, GoHighLevel, Pipedrive, and Zoho — both native reporting and custom external dashboards when CRM-native tools are too limited.

## Service Description

CRM reporting should be effortless. Your team should open a dashboard and immediately see whether the pipeline is healthy, which reps are performing, and where deals are getting stuck. Instead, most teams spend hours each week manually pulling data to answer basic questions.

I build three types of CRM reporting solutions: native reports inside your CRM (fastest to deploy, limited by platform capabilities), external dashboards pulling from your CRM via API (more flexible, supports multi-source data), and full analytics platforms with automated insight generation and alerting.

Every reporting project starts with a metrics workshop where I identify what your team actually needs to track and what decisions those numbers inform. I have seen too many dashboards with 30 metrics where only 5 actually get used. I focus on the metrics that drive action and present them at the right level of detail for each audience.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You need better visibility into your [CRM PLATFORM] data — specifically [METRICS MENTIONED]. I build CRM dashboards every week and can have your first reports live within [TIMELINE].

### Credibility
I built a sales analytics dashboard for a B2B services company on HubSpot that reduced their weekly reporting time from 4 hours of manual Excel work to zero — the dashboard updates in real-time and sends automated weekly summaries to the leadership team.

### Approach
- Metrics workshop: define KPIs, data sources, and audience for each report (Day 1-2)
- Build report suite with visualizations and filters inside [CRM PLATFORM] (Day 3-5)
- Configure scheduled delivery, alerts, and role-based access (Day 6-7)
- Review with your team, refine based on feedback, finalize dashboards (Day 8-10)

### Differentiator
I do not just build reports — I identify which metrics actually matter for your business decisions and present them at the right level for each audience. Your CEO gets a different view than your sales manager, and both get the numbers they need without noise.
