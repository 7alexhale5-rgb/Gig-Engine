# AI Chatbot Implementation — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
AI Chatbot Build | GPT, Claude, RAG | CRM Integration

### Overview
I build AI chatbots trained on your business knowledge base — not generic template bots. Every bot integrates with your CRM, helpdesk, and website, with RAG for accurate responses and seamless human handoff when needed.

I architect AI systems using GPT-4, Claude, and open-source LLMs depending on your requirements for cost, privacy, and performance. My implementations include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate, source-grounded responses, conversation memory for multi-turn interactions, and seamless handoff to human agents when the AI reaches its limits.

As CTO for a construction enterprise and founder of PrettyFly.ai, I build production AI systems daily. I understand the full stack — from prompt engineering and knowledge base design to API integration, deployment, and monitoring. You get an AI system that works in production, not a proof-of-concept that falls apart with real users.

## Service Description

Most AI chatbot implementations fail because they're built as isolated widgets instead of integrated systems. The bot doesn't know your products, can't access customer data, and gives generic responses that send users straight to your support inbox. I build chatbots that are wired into your business from the ground up.

Every implementation starts with your knowledge base — product docs, FAQs, support tickets, and internal processes — structured for retrieval-augmented generation so the AI gives accurate, cited answers instead of hallucinating. I then integrate with your existing stack: CRM for customer context, helpdesk for ticket creation, calendars for booking, and your website or messaging channels for deployment.

The result is an AI assistant that handles 60-80% of inquiries accurately, captures qualified leads with the right questions, escalates complex issues to humans with full context, and improves over time as you feed it more data. I build on GPT-4, Claude, or open-source models depending on your budget, privacy requirements, and use case.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy this proposal and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting before submitting.

### Hook
You want an AI assistant that actually understands your [INDUSTRY/PRODUCT] — not a generic chatbot that sends every question to your support team. I build exactly this.

### Credibility
I recently deployed an AI assistant for a services company that handles 70% of inbound inquiries without human intervention, qualified 3x more leads than their previous form-based system, and reduced average response time from 4 hours to under 30 seconds.

### Approach
- Define conversation flows, knowledge base scope, and integration requirements (Day 1-3)
- Build and train the AI on your business context — docs, FAQs, products, processes (Day 4-7)
- Integrate with your CRM, website, and messaging channels with human handoff logic (Week 2)
- Test with real scenarios, refine responses, deploy with monitoring and analytics dashboard (Week 2-3)

### Differentiator
I'm not just plugging in ChatGPT with a system prompt. I architect AI systems that integrate with your existing tools — CRM lookups, ticket creation, lead capture, appointment booking. As founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO for an enterprise, I bring production-grade engineering to every chatbot build.

### CTA
I can review your current setup and give you a detailed implementation plan by end of week. Available for a 15-minute scoping call — what works for your schedule?
