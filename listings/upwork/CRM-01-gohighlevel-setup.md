## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline

GoHighLevel CRM Setup, Automation & Pipeline Expert (70 chars)

### Overview

I build GoHighLevel systems that actually work -- pipeline automation, lead routing, review generation, and SMS/email sequences that run without oversight. 15+ service businesses optimized. CTO-level architecture, not tutorials stitched together.

Most GHL accounts I audit have the same problem: half-built workflows, broken triggers, and zero automation doing the heavy lifting. I fix that. My builds include full pipeline configuration, lead scoring, automated follow-up sequences, appointment booking flows, and review request campaigns. Every workflow is documented and tested before handoff.

I also serve as CTO for a construction enterprise, so I bring enterprise-level systems thinking to every GHL build. You get architecture that scales -- not a patchwork of tutorials stitched together.

**What I deliver:**
- Pipeline setup with stage-based automation triggers
- Lead routing and scoring logic
- SMS + email nurture sequences
- Review generation campaigns
- Appointment booking and reminder workflows
- Full documentation + walkthrough call

## Service Description

GoHighLevel is powerful, but most accounts barely scratch the surface. I specialize in turning underperforming GHL instances into fully automated lead machines -- from first touch to closed deal to five-star review.

My approach starts with an audit of your current setup: what's working, what's broken, and what's missing entirely. From there I build or rebuild your pipelines, automation workflows, and communication sequences with proper trigger logic, error handling, and documentation. Every build follows a systematic process -- nothing is guesswork.

I've built and optimized GHL systems for 15+ service businesses across construction, real estate, home services, and professional services. Whether you need a fresh setup from scratch or a rescue mission on a half-built system, I deliver a CRM that works for your business without daily babysitting.
