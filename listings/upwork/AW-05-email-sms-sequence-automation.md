# Email & SMS Sequence Automation — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
Email & SMS Automation | Drip Campaigns | Nurture Sequences

### Overview
I build automated email and SMS sequences that turn leads into customers without manual follow-up. Behavioral triggers, conditional branching, lead scoring, multi-channel coordination — the full nurture system, not just a basic drip.

Most businesses have the same problem: leads come in, someone follows up once or twice, then life gets busy and the lead goes cold. An automated sequence fixes this permanently. But a good sequence isn't just "send 5 emails on a timer." It's conditional logic — different messages based on what the lead opens, clicks, or ignores. It's channel switching — moving from email to SMS when engagement drops. It's scoring — flagging hot leads for your sales team before they go cold.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai, I build these systems across Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Twilio, and SendGrid. I handle the technical architecture: triggers, branching, personalization, deliverability configuration, CRM integration, and reporting. You bring the copy and the offer — I build the machine that delivers it at the right time to the right person through the right channel.

## Service Description

Leads cost money to acquire. Every one that goes cold because nobody followed up fast enough is wasted spend. I build automated email and SMS sequences that follow up instantly, adapt based on behavior, and hand off to your sales team at exactly the right moment.

The difference between a sequence that converts and one that gets ignored is in the logic layer. I build conditional branches — if a lead opens email 3 but doesn't click, they get a different follow-up than someone who clicked and visited your pricing page. I set up channel escalation — if email engagement drops after touchpoint 4, the sequence switches to SMS. I configure lead scoring that tags and routes prospects based on cumulative engagement, so your reps only get notified when someone is actually warm.

I work across the major platforms: Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, GoHighLevel, HubSpot, ConvertKit, SendGrid, Brevo for email. Twilio and platform-native SMS for text. I handle deliverability setup (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), list hygiene automation, and compliance. Every project includes CRM integration so the sequence plugs directly into your sales pipeline.

You get full documentation with a visual sequence flow, and your team can adjust copy and timing without touching the automation logic.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You need an automated [EMAIL/SMS] sequence that nurtures [LEAD SOURCE] leads through to [CONVERSION ACTION] without your team manually following up. I build these systems every week across [PLATFORM] and similar tools.

### Credibility
I recently built a 16-touchpoint email + SMS nurture sequence for a SaaS client that increased their trial-to-paid conversion rate by 23% — running on autopilot for 3 months with zero manual intervention.

### Approach
- Map your funnel: lead sources, offer, conversion points, and ideal timing between touchpoints (Day 1-2)
- Design sequence flow with conditional branches, channel logic, and lead scoring rules (Day 3)
- Build all automation steps in [PLATFORM], connect to CRM, configure triggers and personalization (Day 4-7)
- Test every branch with real data, verify deliverability, confirm tracking and scoring (Day 8-9)
- Launch with monitoring, hand off documentation and visual flow diagram (Day 10)

### Differentiator
I don't build simple timed drips. Every sequence I deliver has conditional logic — different paths based on opens, clicks, replies, and inactivity. I set up lead scoring and channel escalation so your hottest leads get flagged for sales and your cold leads get re-engaged automatically.

### CTA
I can sketch a sequence flow for your funnel by tomorrow if you share your lead sources and offer details. Want to jump on a quick call to map it out?
