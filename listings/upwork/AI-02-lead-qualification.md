# AI Lead Qualification System — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
AI Lead Scoring | CRM Integration | Sales Automation

### Overview
I build AI-powered lead qualification systems that score, route, and nurture leads automatically. Your sales team talks to high-intent buyers instead of chasing dead ends. Every system integrates with your CRM and uses your historical close data to predict conversion.

Most lead scoring is still rules-based: "if job title contains VP, add 10 points." I build systems that go further — using AI to analyze behavioral signals, conversation patterns, and engagement data to surface the leads most likely to close. Combined with automated routing, instant follow-up sequences, and chatbot-driven qualification, your pipeline moves faster with less manual effort.

As CTO for a construction enterprise and founder of PrettyFly.ai, I've built sales automation systems that handle real volume across complex B2B pipelines. I understand CRM architecture, data hygiene, and the handoff between marketing automation and sales workflows. You get a system designed by someone who thinks about the full revenue pipeline, not just a scoring algorithm in isolation.

## Service Description

Your sales team is spending too much time on leads that will never close and not enough time on the ones that will. An AI lead qualification system fixes this by automatically scoring every lead based on fit, intent, and engagement — then routing high-value prospects to sales immediately while nurturing the rest through automated sequences.

I build these systems end-to-end: from data analysis and scoring model design to CRM integration, automated routing rules, and qualification chatbots that ask the right questions before a human ever gets involved. The scoring model is trained on your actual close data, so it reflects what a good lead looks like for your specific business — not a generic template.

The complete system typically includes AI-powered lead scoring integrated with your CRM, automated lead routing based on score thresholds and rep assignment rules, a qualification chatbot that captures key information and pre-qualifies before handoff, real-time alerts for high-score leads, and a reporting dashboard that shows pipeline health, conversion rates by score tier, and model accuracy over time.

### Hook
Your sales team is spending [X hours/week] qualifying leads manually, and you're losing high-intent prospects because follow-up takes too long. I build AI systems that solve both problems at once.

### Credibility
I built an AI lead qualification system for a B2B services company that increased their sales team's qualified meeting rate by 40% and reduced time-to-first-contact from 6 hours to under 5 minutes for high-score leads.

### Approach
- Analyze your current lead data, CRM structure, and sales process to define scoring criteria (Week 1)
- Build AI scoring model trained on your historical close/loss data with CRM integration (Week 2)
- Deploy automated routing, qualification chatbot, and instant alert system (Week 3)
- Test with live leads, calibrate scoring thresholds, and deliver reporting dashboard + documentation (Week 4)

### Differentiator
I don't just build a scoring spreadsheet. I architect a complete qualification pipeline — AI scoring, chatbot pre-qualification, automated routing, instant alerts, and analytics — integrated with your CRM so it works inside the tools your team already uses. As a CTO who builds enterprise sales systems, I design for scale and accuracy, not just a demo.

### CTA
I'd like to look at your current CRM data and lead flow to give you a specific implementation plan with projected impact. Available for a 20-minute scoping call this week. When works for you?
