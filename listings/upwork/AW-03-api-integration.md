# API Integration (Connect 2+ Systems) — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
API Integration | REST, GraphQL, Webhooks | Custom Code

### Overview
I build custom code-level API integrations — REST, GraphQL, webhooks, OAuth — that connect your systems with production-grade reliability. From simple one-way syncs to complex bi-directional integrations with conflict resolution and monitoring built in.

This is not no-code drag-and-drop. I write custom integration code for scenarios that require fine-grained control: complex data transformations, multi-step authentication flows, rate limit management, conflict resolution, and custom error recovery logic. When your integration needs go beyond what visual workflow tools can handle, I build the solution in code.

I have integrated CRMs, payment processors, ERPs, project management tools, email platforms, custom databases, and dozens of SaaS APIs in production environments. As CTO for a construction enterprise, I manage 12+ interconnected systems daily — so I understand the real-world complexity of keeping data consistent across platforms that were not designed to work together.

Every integration I deliver handles the edge cases that break simple connections: API rate limits, timeout retries, data format mismatches, duplicate detection, and partial failure recovery. You get clean data flowing between systems with monitoring so you know immediately if something needs attention.

## Service Description

Your systems need to share data, but connecting APIs is where most projects go wrong. Simple integrations look easy until you hit rate limits, data format mismatches, authentication token expiration, or partial failures that leave your data inconsistent across platforms. I build custom code-level integrations that handle all of this from the start.

I specialize in connecting business-critical systems: CRMs to billing platforms, e-commerce to fulfillment, project management to invoicing, marketing tools to analytics — any combination of systems that need reliable data flow. I work directly with REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, webhooks, OAuth 2.0 flows, API keys, and custom authentication schemes at the code level.

My typical integration includes custom data mapping and transformation logic, bidirectional sync with conflict resolution, error handling with retry and alerting, rate limit management, duplicate detection, and comprehensive documentation. Unlike no-code workflow tools (n8n, Make, Zapier), I write production code for integrations that need fine-grained control, complex business logic, or performance at scale.

### Hook
You need [SYSTEM A] and [SYSTEM B] sharing data reliably so your team stops manually transferring [DATA TYPE] between platforms. I build these integrations every week.

### Credibility
I recently built a bi-directional sync between HubSpot and a custom ERP that processes 500+ records daily with zero data loss — running for 6 months with 99.9% uptime.

### Approach
- Map data fields, endpoints, and authentication requirements for both systems (Day 1)
- Build integration with data transformation, error handling, and duplicate detection (Day 2-4)
- Test with real data including edge cases — malformed records, API downtime, rate limits (Day 5)
- Deploy with monitoring dashboard and full documentation (Day 6-7)

### Differentiator
I write custom integration code — not drag-and-drop workflows. When your data transformation is too complex for a visual builder, when you need OAuth token refresh logic, or when performance at scale matters, I build it in code with the same rigor I use for enterprise systems. Your integration works on day one and keeps working on day 300.

### CTA
I can review both APIs today and give you a firm scope by tomorrow. Available to start this week. Want to share the API docs and I'll put together a detailed plan?
