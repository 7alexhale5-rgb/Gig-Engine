# Spreadsheet-to-App Migration — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
Spreadsheet to Web App | Google Sheets Migration | Custom Database App

### Overview
I take the spreadsheet your business runs on — the one with 30 tabs, broken formulas, and 10 people editing simultaneously — and turn it into a proper web application with a database, user accounts, and an interface designed for your workflow. No more version conflicts, no more corrupted formulas, no more five-minute load times.

Every growing business hits the spreadsheet wall. What started as a quick tracker becomes the operating system for an entire department. The data is critical, the process is embedded, but the tool was never designed for this. A custom application preserves everything your team depends on while eliminating everything that makes the spreadsheet painful.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise, I have migrated dozens of spreadsheets into applications — project trackers, equipment logs, inventory systems, client databases, and job costing sheets. I use Next.js, Supabase, and PostgreSQL for the application layer, ensuring your data lives in a proper database with proper validation, proper access control, and proper backup.

## Service Description

Spreadsheet-to-app migration is not just moving data into a database. It is understanding the logic your team has embedded in formulas, the workflows embedded in tab structure, and the tribal knowledge embedded in cell formatting — then rebuilding all of it in a proper application that is faster, more reliable, and easier to use.

I start with a spreadsheet audit: documenting every tab, column, formula, and workflow. I identify what is data (goes into the database), what is logic (becomes application code), and what is presentational (becomes UI design). This migration plan ensures nothing gets lost and your team can verify the application does everything the spreadsheet did.

The application is built with Next.js and Supabase — modern, fast, and maintainable. Your team gets a clean interface with forms for data entry (no more editing raw cells), views organized by workflow (no more 47 tabs), and proper data validation (no more wrong data types in a column). Every tier includes CSV export so your team can still pull data into Excel for ad-hoc analysis when needed.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You have a [SPREADSHEET TYPE] that your team of [NUMBER] uses daily, and it has outgrown the spreadsheet format. I specialize in migrating exactly these kinds of business-critical spreadsheets into proper web applications, and I can have a working version within [TIMELINE].

### Credibility
I migrated a 40-tab project tracking spreadsheet for a construction company into a web application — 15 team members now use it daily with role-based access, automated calculations, and real-time dashboards. Load time went from 45 seconds to under 2 seconds.

### Approach
- Spreadsheet audit: document every tab, column, formula, and workflow (Day 1-3)
- Database schema design and migration plan, approved by you (Day 4-5)
- Build application interface, forms, and views (Day 6-10)
- Migrate data, verify record counts, test calculations (Day 11-12)
- Deploy, train your team, begin parallel-run period (Day 13-14)

### Differentiator
I do not just dump your data into a database and put a generic UI on top. I map every formula, every workflow, and every implicit process in your spreadsheet, then rebuild it as proper application logic. Your team gets an app that does everything the spreadsheet did — faster, more reliably, and with proper data validation.

### CTA
Share your spreadsheet (or a screenshot if sensitive) and tell me what drives you crazy about it — I will show you what the app version looks like and provide a fixed-price estimate within 24 hours.
