# AI Cost Savings Assessment — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
AI Cost Savings Assessment | Vendor Fee Renegotiation | SaaS Stack Audit

### Overview
I audit your vendor contracts, SaaS subscriptions, and professional services spend to identify where AI has changed the economics — and where you're overpaying based on assumptions that no longer hold. You get a dollar-figure report showing exactly which fees to renegotiate, how much to demand, and what AI alternatives exist for each line item.

KPMG just pressured their own auditor into a 14% fee reduction by pointing at AI efficiency gains. That playbook works for every company. Most businesses haven't asked the question yet — which of our vendors are charging pre-AI prices for work that AI has fundamentally changed?

I'm a CTO and AI practitioner who builds production AI systems daily. I don't just tell you "AI could save money here." I quantify it, map the alternatives, and give you the negotiation ammunition. Every recommendation comes with specific numbers: current cost, AI-adjusted cost, savings potential, and the exact talking points for your vendor call.

## Service Description

Every business is paying pre-AI prices for services that AI has made cheaper. The question is which ones and by how much.

In February 2026, KPMG — one of the Big Four accounting firms — forced its own auditor to cut fees by 14% using a simple argument: AI makes this work cheaper, so pass on the savings. That precedent is now cascading through every professional services category: legal, consulting, audit, design, implementation, and per-seat SaaS licensing.

I conduct AI Cost Savings Assessments that identify exactly where this dynamic applies to your business. The assessment covers your SaaS subscriptions (per-seat licensing vs. AI agent alternatives), professional services contracts (legal, accounting, consulting, design), internal processes that still run on headcount assumptions, and vendor relationships where AI has shifted the negotiating leverage in your favor.

The deliverable is a prioritized savings report with specific dollar figures, not a vague strategy deck. For each opportunity, you get: current annual cost, AI-adjusted fair cost, estimated savings, implementation path, and negotiation talking points you can use in your next vendor review.

This isn't about replacing vendors. It's about repricing relationships based on how AI has changed the economics of the work they do for you.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You're paying [NUMBER] vendors and [NUMBER] SaaS subscriptions at rates set before AI changed the economics of their work. KPMG just proved this playbook works — they cut their own audit fees 14% by pointing at AI efficiency. The same logic applies across your entire vendor stack.

### Credibility
I build production AI systems — chatbots, automation pipelines, agentic workflows — so I know exactly what AI can and can't replace in 2026. My last cost assessment for a mid-size services firm identified $4,200/month in renegotiable vendor spend and three SaaS tools that could be replaced with AI agents at 80% lower cost.

### Approach
- Inventory all SaaS subscriptions, per-seat licenses, and professional services contracts with current costs (Week 1)
- Map each cost center against current AI capabilities — what's automatable, what's renegotiable, and what's genuinely irreplaceable (Week 1)
- Deliver prioritized savings report with specific dollar figures, AI alternatives, and vendor negotiation talking points (Week 2)
- Optional: implement the highest-ROI AI replacement from the report (Week 2-3, Premium scope)

### Differentiator
Most AI consultants will tell you to "adopt AI." I'll tell you exactly which line items on your P&L are inflated because your vendors haven't passed on AI efficiency gains — and give you the numbers to negotiate with. Strategy and implementation in one engagement.

### CTA
I can start the assessment this week and have your savings report in 10 business days. Want a quick call to discuss your current vendor stack? I'll review your top 5 subscriptions before the call and come prepared with initial observations.
