### Headline

Analytics & Tracking Setup | GA4, Mixpanel, GTM, Custom Data Pipelines (64 chars)

### Overview

Your analytics are either missing, broken, or telling you things you cannot act on. I fix that. I set up GA4, Mixpanel, and custom tracking implementations that answer the specific questions your business needs answered -- not default dashboards with 50 metrics nobody checks.

Most analytics setups I audit have the same problems: duplicate events, missing conversion tracking, no funnel analysis, and a GA4 instance with default settings that has never been configured for the actual business. I replace all of that with a clean, structured tracking implementation tied to your real business questions. Every event named consistently, every conversion defined, every dashboard built to show what matters.

I am a CTO and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I build production web applications in React and Next.js, which means I understand how tracking works inside real codebases -- SPAs, dynamic forms, server-rendered pages. Your analytics implementation will not break every time your dev team ships an update.

**What I deliver:**
- GA4 and/or Mixpanel setup and configuration
- Google Tag Manager implementation
- Custom event tracking (clicks, forms, scrolls, in-app actions)
- Conversion and funnel tracking
- UTM strategy and campaign tracking framework
- Server-side tracking (first-party data collection)
- Custom reporting dashboards
- Event dictionary and documentation

## Service Description

Analytics should answer questions, not create them. I set up tracking implementations that tie directly to your business model -- which campaigns drive revenue, where users drop off, what content converts, and which segments are worth targeting. If your current setup cannot answer those questions in under 60 seconds, it needs work.

My process starts with your business questions, not your tracking platform. What do you need to know? Where does the data live? What decisions will this inform? From there I define events, build the tracking architecture in GTM, configure your analytics platform, and build dashboards that surface the answers without noise.

I work with GA4, Mixpanel, and custom data pipelines. For most businesses, GA4 with proper configuration is more than enough. For SaaS products and apps that need behavioral analytics, Mixpanel is the better fit. For businesses that want full control over their data, I build custom pipelines that send events to your own database for analysis with any tool you choose.

Every engagement includes a complete event dictionary, QA-tested tracking, and a walkthrough so your team knows how to read the data and act on it.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy this proposal and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting before submitting.

### Hook

Your tracking setup needs to actually answer the questions your team is asking -- not just collect data for the sake of it. I specialize in analytics implementations that tie directly to business decisions.

### Credibility

I have set up analytics for SaaS products, e-commerce stores, and lead gen sites. I build production web apps daily as a CTO, so I understand how tracking needs to work inside real codebases without breaking on every deploy.

### Approach

- Audit current tracking and define key business questions to answer (Day 1-2)
- Design event taxonomy and tracking architecture (Day 2-3)
- Implement GTM, custom events, and conversion tracking for [THEIR SPECIFIC PLATFORM] (Day 3-7)
- Build reporting dashboards and deliver event dictionary + walkthrough (Day 7-10)

### Differentiator

I am not a tag manager -- I am a developer who understands both the tracking layer and the codebase it lives in. Your implementation will be structured, documented, and built to survive code changes. I also build custom data pipelines for teams that want full control over their analytics data.

### CTA

Send me your site URL and I will do a quick audit of your current tracking. I can scope the full project in one call.
