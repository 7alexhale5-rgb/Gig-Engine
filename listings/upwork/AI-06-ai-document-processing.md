# AI Document Processing & Extraction — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
AI Document Processing | OCR & Data Extraction | PDF Automation

### Overview
I build AI-powered systems that extract structured data from your documents — invoices, receipts, contracts, forms, and any other document type with repeatable patterns. The extracted data flows directly into your database, spreadsheet, or business system, eliminating manual data entry.

Most businesses process documents manually. Someone reads an invoice, types the amounts into a spreadsheet, cross-references against a purchase order, and files it. Multiply that by hundreds of documents per month and you have a full-time job that is slow, error-prone, and soul-crushing. AI document processing handles this in seconds with accuracy that matches or exceeds human data entry.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise, I built our internal document processing pipeline that extracts line items from vendor invoices and matches them against purchase orders automatically. I work with GPT-4 Vision for complex layouts, specialized OCR for structured forms, and hybrid approaches when needed. I understand both the AI technology and the business context — you need accuracy, speed, and a system that handles messy real-world documents.

## Service Description

AI document processing replaces manual data entry with automated extraction. You feed documents in (PDF, image, or scanned), and structured data comes out (JSON, CSV, database records, or API calls to your business systems).

I build extraction pipelines using the best tool for each document type. GPT-4 Vision handles complex, variable layouts (contracts with different formats from different vendors). Specialized OCR engines handle structured forms (tax documents, insurance claims, standardized invoices). For most real-world scenarios, I use a hybrid approach — OCR for text extraction and LLM for understanding context and structure.

Every extraction pipeline includes confidence scoring (each extracted value gets a confidence percentage), validation rules (amounts must be positive, dates must be valid, required fields must be present), and error handling (low-confidence extractions get flagged for human review instead of being silently wrong). For Premium engagements, I implement a learning loop where human corrections feed back to improve future extraction accuracy.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You need to extract [SPECIFIC FIELDS] from [DOCUMENT TYPE] automatically instead of having someone key it in manually. I have built exactly this type of extraction pipeline for [SIMILAR INDUSTRY] and can get you a working prototype within a week.

### Credibility
I built a document processing system for a construction company that extracts line items, totals, and PO numbers from vendor invoices across 30+ different vendor formats — processing 200+ invoices per month with 97% extraction accuracy and zero manual data entry.

### Approach
- Review 10-20 sample documents, identify fields to extract, document format variations (Day 1-2)
- Build extraction pipeline with OCR + AI, configure field mapping and validation rules (Day 3-6)
- Test against full sample set, measure accuracy, refine for edge cases (Day 7-9)
- Deploy with monitoring, process first batch with your team reviewing output (Day 10-12)
- Tune and hand off documentation (Day 13-14)

### Differentiator
I build extraction pipelines that handle real-world document messiness — scanned at an angle, inconsistent vendor formats, handwritten notes, and missing fields. Every extraction includes confidence scoring and validation, so bad data gets flagged instead of silently entering your system.

### CTA
Send me 5-10 sample documents and tell me what fields you need extracted — I will process them and show you the structured output within 48 hours.
