## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline

GoHighLevel Funnels & Landing Pages | Lead Capture | Conversion Optimization (72 chars)

### Overview

I build GoHighLevel funnels that turn ad traffic into booked calls -- not just pretty pages with no follow-up. Every funnel includes the automation behind it: lead capture, SMS/email sequences, pipeline integration, and conversion tracking. The page is only half the job.

Most GHL funnels I audit have the same problem: decent-looking page, zero automation after the form submit. The lead comes in, gets a generic email, and goes cold. My builds wire up the entire post-submission experience -- instant text-back, drip sequences, calendar booking, pipeline stage assignment -- so leads move through your sales process without manual intervention.

I have been building funnels for over a decade and I serve as CTO for a construction enterprise. I treat every funnel as a system, not a page. You get proper tracking, tested sequences, and documentation so you can manage it yourself after delivery.

**What I deliver:**
- Custom landing pages built inside your GHL account
- Multi-step funnels with conversion-optimized layouts
- Automated SMS + email follow-up sequences
- Calendar booking integration
- Pipeline and tag assignment on opt-in
- Tracking pixel setup (Facebook, Google)
- A/B testing configuration
- Documentation + walkthrough call

## Service Description

A landing page without automation is a billboard with no phone number. I build GoHighLevel funnels as complete systems -- the page, the form, the thank-you sequence, the SMS follow-up, the pipeline integration, and the tracking. Everything wired together inside your GHL account.

My approach starts with your offer and traffic source. A funnel for Facebook retargeting needs a completely different structure than one for cold Google search traffic. I design the page flow and automation logic before writing a line of code or dragging a single element. That is why my funnels convert -- they are built around how your specific leads behave, not a generic template.

I have built conversion funnels for service businesses, agencies, coaches, and e-commerce operators. Whether you need a single high-converting landing page or a multi-step funnel with A/B testing and full analytics, I deliver a system that runs without you babysitting it. You get the source build inside your GHL account, documentation, and a walkthrough so your team can make changes confidently.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy this proposal and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting before submitting.

### Hook

You need a funnel that actually converts -- not just a page that looks nice. I build GoHighLevel funnels with the full automation stack behind them.

### Credibility

I have built GHL funnels for 15+ service businesses with conversion rates consistently above 10%. Every build includes the page, the sequences, and the pipeline integration.

### Approach

- Review your offer, audience, and traffic source to plan the funnel structure (Day 1)
- Design and build landing page(s) with lead capture forms inside your GHL account (Day 2-4)
- Wire up SMS + email follow-up sequences and pipeline automation (Day 4-6)
- Set up tracking pixels, test all flows end-to-end, and deliver with documentation (Day 6-8)

### Differentiator

I do not just build pages -- I build the entire conversion system. The automation after the form submit is where most funnels fail, and that is exactly where I focus. I also serve as CTO for an enterprise, so I think in systems, not templates.

### CTA

Happy to jump on a 15-minute call to scope this. Send me your offer details and traffic source and I will sketch out a funnel structure before we start.
