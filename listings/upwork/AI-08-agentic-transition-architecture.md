# Agentic Transition Architecture — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
CTO-Level AI Agent Architect | I Replace Per-Seat SaaS Tools with Custom Agents

### Overview
The per-seat SaaS model is dying. Your company is paying $50-200/user/month for tools where half the features go unused, and every new hire means another license. I architect and build AI agents that replace those per-seat interfaces — same work done, no logins required, fraction of the cost.

I'm Alex Hale, CTO and founder of PrettyFly.ai. I build production AI agent systems daily. Not demos, not proofs of concept — real agents handling real business operations. I also serve as CTO for an enterprise construction company, so I understand the stakes when you're replacing tools that teams depend on.

My approach: keep your systems of record (databases, data platforms), replace the per-seat access layer with purpose-built AI agents. Your data stays where it is. Your agents just work smarter and cheaper than a wall of SaaS subscriptions.

### Skills
AI Architecture, AI Agents, LLM Integration, Python, TypeScript, Node.js, n8n, RAG, Vector Databases, Supabase, PostgreSQL, API Development, System Architecture, SaaS Migration, Process Automation

### Hourly Rate
$150/hr

## Service Description

Your SaaS stack is your biggest controllable cost after payroll. The shift from "System of Record" to "System of Action" means you can keep your data platforms but replace the per-seat tools that sit on top of them. Only 14% of enterprises have done this. The window to get ahead of your competition is right now.

I audit your SaaS stack, identify the tools ripe for agent replacement, design the architecture, and build production agents that do the work without human logins. This is NOT cost consulting or vendor negotiation (that's a different service). This is architecture and build.

Typical engagement flow:

1. **Discovery call** (30 min, free) — I learn your stack, team size, pain points, and budget constraints
2. **SaaS audit & scoring** — Every per-seat tool gets rated on replacement feasibility, impact, and risk
3. **Architecture blueprint** — Agent specs, data flow diagrams, integration points, migration sequence
4. **Agent build** — Production code with tests, monitoring, error handling, documentation
5. **Deploy & validate** — Real data, real workflows, parallel run period, team training

Most AI consultants hand you a strategy deck. I hand you working agents. I write the code, deploy the infrastructure, and verify it works with your actual data. Architecture-first, but always aimed at production.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You're spending [ESTIMATED MONTHLY SAAS COST] per month on [NUMBER] per-seat tools across your [TEAM SIZE]-person team. The tools you've flagged — [TOOL 1, TOOL 2, TOOL 3] — are exactly the type that respond well to agent replacement.

### Credibility
I specialize in this exact transition. I've architected agent systems that replaced per-seat CRM interfaces, customer support platforms, and document processing tools — typically cutting costs 60-80% while improving throughput because agents don't take breaks or forget steps.

### Approach
- **Week 1:** Full audit of your SaaS stack with replacement scoring matrix
- **Week 2:** Architecture blueprint with agent specs and migration sequence
- **Weeks 3-[X]:** Build and deploy [NUMBER] production agents, starting with [HIGHEST IMPACT TOOL]
- **Final week:** Parallel run validation + team training session

### Differentiator
My approach is "keep your systems of record, replace the per-seat interfaces." Your [DATABASE/DATA PLATFORM] stays exactly where it is. The agents just interact with it directly instead of through expensive SaaS UIs.

### CTA
I'm a CTO who builds production AI systems daily — not a consultant who hands you a slide deck. Happy to do a 15-minute scoping call this week to confirm fit and timeline.
