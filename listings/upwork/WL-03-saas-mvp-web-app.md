# SaaS MVP / Web App Build — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
SaaS MVP & Web App Development | Next.js, Supabase, Full Stack

### Overview
I build SaaS MVPs and web applications that ship to production — not prototypes that look good in a demo and break under real usage. My stack is Next.js 14, Supabase, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Auth, database, billing, admin panel, API — all production-ready from day one.

Most founders and product owners waste months going back and forth with developers who build the wrong thing or deliver code that needs to be rewritten before launch. I prevent that by starting with a clear architecture spec you approve before development begins, then building in weekly sprints with a live staging link so you see real progress and can course-correct early.

I'm a CTO and the founder of PrettyFly.ai. I've taken SaaS products from idea to paying users, and I've inherited enough messy codebases to know exactly what shortcuts to avoid. When I build your MVP, I'm thinking about what happens after launch — adding features, onboarding your first 100 users, integrating with other tools — because a good MVP is the foundation you build a business on.

## Service Description

Building a SaaS product or web app is a bet — you're spending money before you know if the market wants what you're building. The goal of an MVP is to test that bet as fast and cheaply as possible with a product that's good enough to charge for. Not a mockup. Not a landing page with a waitlist. A working application that real users can sign up for and use.

I build MVPs that are production-ready from day one. That means proper authentication, a real database with migrations, error handling, mobile responsiveness, and clean enough code that you or another developer can extend it without a rewrite. I use Next.js 14 and Supabase because it's the fastest path from idea to deployed product without sacrificing quality.

My process is designed to reduce risk. I start with a scoping session where we define the feature set, user flows, and database architecture in a clear spec document. You approve the architecture before I start building. Then I develop in weekly sprints — you get a staging link, you test it, you give feedback, I iterate. No disappearing for a month and coming back with something you didn't ask for.

If your MVP needs billing, I integrate Stripe for subscriptions, one-time payments, or metered usage. If you need an admin panel, I build one. If you need API endpoints for a mobile app or third-party integrations, that's included. You get the full source code, deployed to your domain, with documentation.

### Hook
You need a working SaaS product, not another prototype — something real users can sign up for, use, and pay you for. That's exactly what I build.

### Credibility
I'm a CTO who has taken SaaS products from idea to production with paying users. My stack is Next.js 14, Supabase, TypeScript, and Tailwind — the same tools I use for my own products because they ship fast and hold up at scale.

### Approach
- Scoping call to define MVP feature set, user flows, and data model (Day 1-3)
- Architecture spec with database schema and component breakdown — you approve before code starts (Day 3-5)
- Build core feature modules with auth and database (Day 5-14)
- Build [ADDITIONAL FEATURES: admin panel, billing, API endpoints] (Day 14-21)
- Testing, deployment, documentation, and walkthrough (Day 21-28)

### Differentiator
CTO-level architecture at freelance pricing. I build MVPs that are production-ready — not throwaway code you'll need to rewrite in 3 months. Clean TypeScript, proper database design, modular architecture built to extend.

### CTA
Happy to jump on a 20-minute call to scope the MVP together. I can usually start within the week.
