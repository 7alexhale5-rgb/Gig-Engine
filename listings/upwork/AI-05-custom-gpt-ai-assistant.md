# Custom GPT / AI Assistant Build — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
Custom GPT & AI Assistant | OpenAI API | Prompt Engineering

### Overview
I build custom GPTs and AI assistants that know your business, follow your rules, and integrate with your tools. Whether you need a ChatGPT Custom GPT for your team or a full API-powered assistant embedded in your website, I handle the prompt engineering, knowledge base setup, and integration work.

A generic AI gives generic answers. A custom GPT trained on your SOPs, product documentation, and internal processes gives answers that sound like your best employee. The difference is in the prompt engineering, the knowledge architecture, and the guardrails that prevent hallucination. Most businesses want the power of GPT focused on their specific domain — that is exactly what I deliver.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise, I build AI assistants that actually get used in production. My own company runs on custom GPTs for project documentation, estimating assistance, and internal knowledge management. I understand the OpenAI API, Assistants API, function calling, and the prompt engineering required to make an AI assistant genuinely useful.

## Service Description

Custom GPTs and AI assistants transform how teams access information and complete tasks. Instead of searching through documentation, asking colleagues, or re-reading SOPs, your team asks the AI and gets an accurate, contextual answer in seconds.

I build three types of AI assistants: ChatGPT Custom GPTs (simplest — lives inside ChatGPT, great for teams on ChatGPT Plus/Enterprise), OpenAI Assistants API implementations (embeddable in websites and apps with function calling), and full AI platforms with admin panels, usage analytics, and multi-tool integration.

The key to a useful AI assistant is not the model — it is the prompt engineering and knowledge architecture. I structure your knowledge files for optimal retrieval, engineer system prompts that control tone and accuracy, configure function calling for live data access, and set up guardrails so the AI says "I don't know" rather than hallucinating. Every assistant I build goes through a testing phase where I validate responses against real questions from your team.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You want a custom AI assistant that [SPECIFIC USE CASE] using your [KNOWLEDGE SOURCE]. I build these regularly using the OpenAI API and can have a working prototype within [TIMELINE].

### Credibility
I built a custom GPT for a construction company that handles project documentation queries — it answers questions about specs, timelines, and budgets using 200+ uploaded documents with 95%+ accuracy, saving the team 3-4 hours per week of manual document searching.

### Approach
- Review your knowledge files, define assistant behavior spec, and identify integration points (Day 1-2)
- Engineer system prompts, configure knowledge base, set up guardrails (Day 3-4)
- Build integration layer — function calling, web widget, or API endpoints as needed (Day 5-7)
- Test with 50+ real questions from your team, refine prompts based on results (Day 8-9)
- Deploy, train your team, and begin 1-week tuning period (Day 10)

### Differentiator
I focus on accuracy and adoption, not flashy demos. Every assistant I build includes guardrails against hallucination, confidence-based responses, and a testing protocol against real use cases. The goal is an AI your team trusts enough to use daily.

### CTA
Share your knowledge files and describe the questions your team needs answered — I can build a prototype and share a demo within a week.
