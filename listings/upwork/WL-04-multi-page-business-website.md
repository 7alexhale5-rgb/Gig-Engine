# Multi-Page Business Website — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
Business Website Development | Next.js, SEO, Responsive, Fast

### Overview
Custom-coded business websites that load fast, rank well, and cost nothing to host. Built in Next.js and deployed to Vercel — not WordPress, not Squarespace, not Wix. You get a site that scores 90+ on Lighthouse, works perfectly on mobile, and you own every line of code.

I build business websites for companies that care about how they show up online but don't want to pay $30/month forever for a page builder that loads slowly. My approach is simple: I hand-code your site in Next.js with Tailwind CSS, optimize every page for SEO and performance, and deploy it to Vercel where hosting is free for most business sites. The result is a website that loads in under a second, ranks better than template-based competitors, and costs you nothing after delivery.

Every site includes mobile-first responsive design, on-page SEO, analytics integration, and form connections to your CRM or email platform. Standard and above include CMS integration so you can update content yourself — blog posts, team bios, service descriptions — without calling a developer.

## Service Description

A business website has one job: make people trust you enough to take the next step — call, book, buy, or fill out a form. That trust starts with speed (slow sites feel unprofessional), continues with design (it has to look like you're good at what you do), and is sealed by content that answers the visitor's real questions.

I build business websites in Next.js and deploy them to Vercel. That combination produces sites that load faster, rank better on Google, and cost less to host than WordPress, Squarespace, or any other page builder. You get clean, hand-coded pages optimized for Core Web Vitals — the performance metrics Google uses to rank search results.

My process starts with your sitemap and content, and I work with you to structure each page for the web. If you have polished copy, great. If you have rough notes and bullet points, I can work with that too. Every site ships with proper SEO metadata, mobile-responsive design, analytics, and form integration. You get the full source code, deployed to your domain, with documentation.

For sites that need ongoing content updates — blog posts, news, portfolio items — I integrate a headless CMS so you can publish without touching code. No developer on retainer, no platform fees, just a clean editing interface for the content that changes.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
Your website should be the hardest-working salesperson in your company — available 24/7, fast, and clear about what you do and why someone should choose you. I build sites that do exactly that.

### Credibility
I build business websites in Next.js that consistently score 90+ on Lighthouse and load in under 1 second. My background is CTO-level full stack development — same engineering standards whether I'm building a SaaS product or a 6-page business site.

### Approach
- Review [THEIR BUSINESS] and define sitemap, content structure, and page goals (Day 1-2)
- Build responsive pages with SEO optimization and form integration (Day 3-7)
- CMS setup, analytics integration, and content population (Day 7-9)
- Deploy to [their domain], submit to Search Console, final performance audit (Day 9-10)

### Differentiator
Hand-coded in Next.js, not dragged and dropped. Your site loads faster, ranks better, and costs $0/month to host on Vercel. No WordPress maintenance headaches, no Squarespace subscription, no vendor lock-in.

### CTA
I can have a staging link ready for review within a week. Want to jump on a quick call to scope it out?
