## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline

Custom Analytics Dashboard -- React, Next.js, Real-Time Data (62 chars)

### Overview

Not a spreadsheet with charts -- a custom web app with real-time data on any device. I build production dashboards in React and Next.js that connect to your data sources and display the KPIs your team needs. Any browser, no software to install.

I build dashboards as standalone web applications using React, Next.js, and Supabase. Your data flows in from APIs, databases, or third-party tools. The result is a responsive, authenticated dashboard your team can access from their phone, tablet, or desktop -- no software to install, no licenses to manage.

Most "dashboard" projects on freelance platforms deliver a Google Data Studio report or a Retool embed. I build the real thing: custom-coded, deployed to your domain, with proper authentication, role-based access, and real-time data connections. If your data changes, your dashboard updates.

**What I deliver:**
- KPI definition and data source mapping
- Custom React/Next.js dashboard application
- Real-time data connections (API, database, webhooks)
- Authentication and role-based access
- Mobile-responsive design
- Deployment to your domain (Vercel/custom hosting)
- Documentation + walkthrough

### Skills

React, Next.js, Dashboard Development, Data Visualization, Recharts, Supabase, REST API, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Analytics

### Hourly Rate

## Service Description

Your business data is scattered across five different tools, and the only person who can pull a report is the one who built the spreadsheet. I solve that by building custom dashboard applications -- real web apps with real-time data, accessible from any device, with proper authentication.

My stack is React and Next.js on the frontend, Supabase (PostgreSQL) on the backend, and Recharts for visualizations. I connect to your existing data sources via APIs, database connections, or webhooks. The result looks and feels like a product your team would pay for -- because it's built with the same tools and standards.

Every dashboard starts with a KPI definition session: what numbers matter, where the data lives, and who needs to see what. From there I design the layout, build the data layer, and deploy a working application to your domain. You get full source code, documentation, and a walkthrough so your team (or your next developer) can maintain and extend it.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy this proposal and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting before submitting.

### Hook

You need to see your business metrics in one place instead of logging into 5 different tools. I build exactly that.

### Credibility

I have built production dashboards for operations, revenue, and project tracking -- custom web apps with real-time data, not spreadsheet exports.

### Approach

- Define KPIs and map data sources with you (Day 1-2)
- Design dashboard layout with your priorities front and center (Day 3-4)
- Build real-time data connections and visualization components (Day 5-12)
- Deploy to your domain with authentication + mobile responsiveness (Day 12-14)

### Differentiator

This is not a spreadsheet with charts. It is a custom web app -- real-time, any device, deployed to your domain. I also serve as CTO for an enterprise, so I build dashboards that scale.

### CTA

Happy to do a quick scoping call. I can start this week and have a working prototype in 5 days.
