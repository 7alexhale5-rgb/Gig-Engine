# KPI Reporting System Build — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
KPI Reporting System | Executive Dashboards | Business Intelligence

### Overview
I build KPI reporting systems that put your most important business metrics in one place — automatically updated, clearly visualized, and accessible to every stakeholder who needs them. From operational dashboards for managers to executive summaries for the board, I deliver reporting infrastructure that eliminates manual report generation.

Most leadership teams make decisions based on numbers they cannot easily access. Someone pulls data from 4 different tools into a spreadsheet every Monday to produce a report that is already stale by the time it lands. A proper KPI reporting system connects directly to your data sources, computes metrics in real time, and presents them at the right level of detail for each audience.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise, I build reporting systems for businesses where KPIs directly drive operational decisions. I work with React, Next.js, Supabase, and chart libraries for custom solutions, or Metabase and Retool for faster deployments — always choosing the approach that matches your team's needs and technical capacity.

## Service Description

A KPI reporting system replaces the weekly ritual of pulling data from multiple tools, combining it in a spreadsheet, and emailing it around as a PDF. Instead, your metrics update automatically, your dashboards are always current, and your scheduled reports deliver themselves.

I build reporting systems at three levels: dashboard-only (a single view with your core KPIs), multi-page reporting (department views, drill-downs, and scheduled delivery), and full BI platforms (automated insights, threshold alerts, forecasting, and board-ready report generation).

The most critical part of a KPI project is not the technology — it is defining the right metrics. I start every project with a metrics workshop where we identify which numbers actually drive decisions, where the data lives, and what thresholds separate "on track" from "needs attention." I have seen dashboards with 40 metrics where only 6 get used. My approach is to surface the metrics that drive action and eliminate the noise.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You need a reporting system that shows [SPECIFIC METRICS] from [DATA SOURCES] in one dashboard your [AUDIENCE] can check daily. I build exactly this type of system and can have a working version within [TIMELINE].

### Credibility
I built a KPI reporting system for a construction enterprise that consolidates project financials, crew utilization, and safety metrics from 4 source systems into an executive dashboard — used daily by the leadership team to make operational decisions.

### Approach
- KPI workshop: define metrics, data sources, audiences, and thresholds (Day 1-2)
- Connect data sources, implement metric calculations, design dashboard layout (Day 3-7)
- Build visualizations, configure role-based views, set up scheduled reports (Day 8-11)
- Test with real data, verify accuracy against source systems (Day 12-13)
- Deploy, configure alerts, train your team, hand off documentation (Day 14)

### Differentiator
I start with what decisions your team makes, then work backward to what numbers they need. Most dashboard projects fail because they show data without context — my dashboards show whether each metric is on target, trending up or down, and how it compares to last period. Actionable, not just informational.

### CTA
Send me the list of metrics your leadership team checks weekly (or wishes they could) — I will design the dashboard layout and provide a fixed-price estimate within 24 hours.
