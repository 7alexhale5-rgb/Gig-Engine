# n8n / Make Workflow Build — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
n8n & Make Workflow Automation | No-Code | Self-Hosted

### Overview
I build production-grade workflow automations with n8n and Make that connect your systems and eliminate manual data entry. Self-hosted, no per-task fees, with error handling and monitoring built in. CTO-level architecture for real business complexity.

As CTO for a construction enterprise, I architect no-code and low-code automation systems that handle real operational volume — not toy demos. My workflows process thousands of records daily across CRMs, ERPs, payment platforms, email systems, and SaaS tools using visual workflow builders (n8n, Make). Every build includes error handling, retry logic, logging, and documentation so your team can maintain it without me.

Whether you need a simple two-system sync or a multi-step orchestration spanning 5+ platforms, I scope it clearly, build it fast, and hand it off with full documentation. I specialize in no-code/low-code automation platforms: n8n (self-hosted), Make, and visual workflow design — not custom code-level API work.

## Service Description

Businesses waste 10-20 hours per week on manual data transfer between systems that should talk to each other. I build visual workflow automations using no-code/low-code platforms like n8n (self-hosted) and Make that permanently eliminate that manual work — with production-grade error handling, retry logic, and monitoring so your automations run reliably without babysitting.

Every workflow I deliver is built for the real world: edge cases handled, errors caught and routed, and full documentation so your team understands what runs and why. I use n8n self-hosted by default because it gives you zero per-task fees, full data control, and unlimited executions — a significant cost advantage over Zapier or cloud-only tools at any meaningful volume. Your team can visually edit and extend these workflows without writing code.

My background as CTO for a construction enterprise means I bring systems-level thinking to every automation. I don't just connect A to B — I map your entire data flow, identify failure points, and build visual workflows that scale as your operations grow.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy this proposal and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting before submitting.

### Hook
You need [SYSTEM A] talking to [SYSTEM B] without anyone manually copying data between them. I build these integrations daily and can scope this quickly.

### Credibility
I recently built a multi-system automation for a construction enterprise that eliminated 15+ hours of weekly manual data entry across their CRM, project management, and invoicing platforms.

### Approach
- Map complete data flow between your systems and define trigger logic (Day 1-2)
- Build production-ready n8n workflow with error handling and retry logic (Day 3-5)
- Test with real data including edge cases — bad inputs, API timeouts, duplicates (Day 6)
- Deploy with monitoring, alerting, and full documentation + walkthrough call (Day 7)

### Differentiator
I build on n8n self-hosted so you own the infrastructure — no per-task fees that balloon as volume grows. Your team gets visual workflows they can understand and modify without writing code. As a CTO who architects enterprise systems daily, I design automations that handle real-world complexity, not just the happy path.

### CTA
I can start this week. Happy to jump on a 15-minute call to map your systems and give you a firm scope and timeline. What does your calendar look like?
