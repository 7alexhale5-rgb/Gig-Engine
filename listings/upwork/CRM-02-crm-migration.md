## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline

CRM Migration Specialist -- HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, GHL (69 chars)

### Overview

Migrating CRMs is painful when done wrong and invisible when done right. I make it invisible. Contacts, deals, automations, and custom fields moved cleanly with validation at every step. HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, GHL -- all covered.

I have handled migrations between every major CRM platform. My process includes a full source-system audit, field mapping, data cleaning, test migration, parallel run period, and final cutover. Nothing gets lost, nothing breaks, and your team keeps working during the transition.

Most migration projects fail because someone exports a CSV and imports it into the new system without thinking about relationships, automations, or data integrity. I map every field, relationship, and workflow before touching a single record. Then I rebuild your automations in the new system and run both platforms in parallel until you're confident everything is right.

**What I deliver:**
- Source system audit and data quality assessment
- Complete field and relationship mapping document
- Data migration with validation reports
- Automation and workflow rebuild in new system
- Parallel run period (1-2 weeks)
- Team training + post-migration support

## Service Description

CRM migrations are high-stakes projects where the cost of getting it wrong is measured in lost deals, broken follow-ups, and weeks of manual cleanup. I treat every migration as a data integrity project first and a CRM project second.

My process starts with a thorough audit of your source system -- not just what data exists, but how it's structured, what automations depend on it, and where the data quality issues are hiding. I build a complete field mapping document before any data moves. Then I run a test migration, validate the results, rebuild your automations in the target system, and operate both platforms in parallel until you're confident in the cutover.

Whether you're moving from Salesforce to HubSpot, Pipedrive to GoHighLevel, or consolidating multiple CRMs into one system, I handle the entire process end-to-end. You stay focused on selling while I handle the plumbing.
