# Data Pipeline & ETL Build — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
Data Pipeline & ETL Build | Data Engineering | Automated Sync

### Overview
I build data pipelines that pull from your sources, transform the data, and deliver it where it needs to go — on schedule, with error handling, and without manual intervention. Whether you need a simple sync between two systems or a full ETL pipeline feeding a data warehouse, I deliver production-grade infrastructure that runs reliably.

Most businesses reach a point where manual data exports and CSV uploads cannot keep up. Your CRM data needs to feed your analytics tool, your e-commerce platform needs to sync with your inventory system, and your finance team needs consolidated numbers from 4 different sources. Every hour someone spends on manual data wrangling is an hour not spent on analysis or decisions.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise, I have built pipelines that sync project management data across platforms, consolidate financial reporting from multiple business units, and feed real-time dashboards from operational systems. I work with PostgreSQL, Python, Node.js, REST APIs, and cloud-native tools — choosing the simplest technology that handles your volume reliably.

## Service Description

Your data lives in silos. CRM over here, accounting over there, operations in a spreadsheet, and marketing metrics in three different ad platforms. Every report requires someone to manually pull, clean, and combine data from multiple sources. A well-built data pipeline eliminates this entirely.

I build extract-transform-load pipelines that connect to your data sources (databases, APIs, SaaS tools, spreadsheets), apply the transformations you need (cleaning, deduplication, normalization, joins, calculations), and deliver structured data to your destination (data warehouse, dashboard, API, or reporting tool). Every pipeline includes error handling, retry logic, logging, and alerting so you know it is running correctly without babysitting it.

For smaller workloads, I use Python or Node.js scripts with PostgreSQL — simple, maintainable, and cost-effective. For larger or more complex pipelines, I work with Apache Airflow, dbt, or cloud-native services. I always recommend the simplest tool that handles your volume, because over-engineering a pipeline makes it harder to maintain.

Every pipeline I deliver includes monitoring (you can see what ran, what succeeded, and what failed), documentation (data flow diagrams and a runbook), and a testing strategy so you can validate the output against your source data.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You need to sync data between [SOURCE SYSTEMS] and get it into [DESTINATION] automatically, without manual CSV exports. I build these pipelines every week and can have yours running reliably within [TIMELINE].

### Credibility
I recently built an ETL pipeline for a construction enterprise that consolidates project financial data from 4 source systems into a PostgreSQL warehouse, feeding a real-time dashboard used by the executive team. It processes 50K+ records daily with zero manual intervention.

### Approach
- Audit your data sources, map fields, and document transformation requirements (Day 1-2)
- Design pipeline architecture with error handling and monitoring plan (Day 3)
- Build extraction layer — connect to all source systems and validate data pull (Day 4-6)
- Build transformation and loading layers, implement validation rules (Day 7-10)
- Test with real data, verify row counts and accuracy, deploy with monitoring (Day 11-14)

### Differentiator
I do not over-engineer pipelines. I choose the simplest technology that handles your data volume reliably — Python scripts for small pipelines, Airflow for complex orchestration. Every pipeline I build includes proper error handling, alerting, and documentation, because a pipeline nobody can troubleshoot is a liability.

### CTA
Share your data sources and where the data needs to go — I can sketch the pipeline architecture and give you a fixed-price estimate within 24 hours.
