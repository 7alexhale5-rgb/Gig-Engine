## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline

High-Conversion Landing Page -- React/Next.js, SEO, Mobile-First (64 chars)

### Overview

Production-grade code, not drag-and-drop. I build landing pages that load fast, rank well, and convert -- hand-coded in React/Next.js with CRM integration and zero page builder bloat. Sub-2-second load times, mobile-first, SEO-ready.

Your landing page has 3 seconds to prove visitors should stay. I build pages engineered for that moment: clear value proposition above the fold, conversion-focused layout, sub-2-second load times, and mobile-first responsive design. Every page ships with SEO metadata, structured data, analytics integration, and form connections to your CRM or email platform.

I don't use Webflow, Wix, or WordPress page builders. Every page is custom-coded in React and Next.js, which means faster load times, cleaner code, better SEO, and full ownership -- no monthly platform fees, no vendor lock-in. You get the source code, deployed to Vercel or your hosting of choice.

**What I deliver:**
- Conversion-focused layout and copy structure
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Sub-2-second page load (Lighthouse 90+)
- SEO metadata, Open Graph tags, structured data
- Form integration (CRM, email, webhook)
- Analytics setup (GA4, conversion tracking)
- Source code + deployment

## Service Description

Most landing pages are built in drag-and-drop tools that load slowly, rank poorly, and lock you into monthly subscriptions. I take a different approach: every page is hand-coded in React and Next.js, optimized for speed, SEO, and conversion from the ground up.

My process starts with your goal -- lead capture, demo booking, product launch, event registration -- and works backward to the layout, copy structure, and technical integration that gets results. Every page is mobile-first, loads in under 2 seconds, and includes proper SEO metadata, Open Graph tags for social sharing, and form connections to your existing tools.

You get full source code ownership, deployment to Vercel or your preferred host, and a page that performs like a product -- because it's built with the same tools and standards I use for production web applications.
