## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline

Custom Admin Panel & Internal Tools | React, Next.js, TypeScript (62 chars)

### Overview

I build custom admin panels and back-office tools that replace the spreadsheets and overpriced SaaS tools your team fights with every day. Full-stack builds in React, Next.js, and Supabase -- deployed to your domain, fully owned by you, zero monthly platform fees.

Most internal tools on Upwork get delivered as Retool embeds or WordPress admin hacks. I build real applications. Data tables with search, filter, and sort. CRUD forms with validation. Role-based access so your manager sees different things than your intern. Audit trails so you know who changed what. The same architecture I use for production systems at the enterprise I serve as CTO for.

My stack is React, Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL), and Tailwind CSS. Every build is modular -- start with one module and add more as your operations grow. You get source code, documentation, and a walkthrough. No lock-in.

**What I deliver:**
- Custom CRUD modules for your operational data
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data tables with search, filter, sort, and pagination
- Data import/export (CSV, Excel)
- Activity logging and audit trails
- API integrations (Stripe, QuickBooks, Slack, etc.)
- Deployed to your domain with authentication
- Source code + documentation + training

## Service Description

Your operations team is managing critical business data in spreadsheets, or you are paying per-seat for a SaaS tool that does not quite fit. I build the third option: a custom admin panel that does exactly what your team needs, deployed on your infrastructure, with no monthly platform fees.

I treat every admin panel like a product. That means a proper data model, clean UI with intuitive forms and tables, role-based permissions, and an architecture that a future developer can extend without rewriting. My builds use React and Next.js for the frontend, Supabase for the database and auth, and TypeScript throughout. It is the same stack running production SaaS applications.

The process is simple: we define your data model and workflows together, I build in sprints with a staging link you can test from day one, and I deploy to your domain when it is ready. Past builds include project management tools, vendor portals, inventory systems, customer management platforms, and financial dashboards -- all custom, all still in production.

Every project ends with source code, documentation, and a training walkthrough. I build things that last.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy this proposal and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting before submitting.

### Hook

You need a custom [admin panel / internal tool / back-office system] that fits your actual workflow -- not another SaaS tool that almost works. I build exactly that.

### Credibility

I have built custom admin panels and internal tools for operations teams across [RELEVANT INDUSTRIES]. My stack is React, Next.js, and Supabase -- the same tools powering production SaaS products. I also serve as CTO for an enterprise where I built the internal tools that manage a multi-million dollar operation.

### Approach

- Map out your data model, user roles, and core workflows (Day 1-2)
- Build first CRUD module with auth and deploy to staging (Day 3-7)
- Add remaining modules: [LIST THEIR SPECIFIC MODULES] (Day 7-18)
- Integration, testing, deployment to your domain + training (Day 18-21)

### Differentiator

This is not a Retool embed or a WordPress plugin. It is a custom-coded application you fully own -- no per-seat fees, no platform limitations. I build it modular so you can add features over time without a rewrite.

### CTA

Happy to scope this on a 15-minute call. I can have a working prototype with your first module in under a week.
