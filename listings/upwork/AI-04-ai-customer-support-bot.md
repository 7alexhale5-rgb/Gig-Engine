# AI-Powered Customer Support Bot — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
AI Support Bot | Helpdesk Automation | Ticket Routing & Auto-Reply

### Overview
I build AI-powered support bots that actually resolve tickets — not just acknowledge them. Every bot is trained on your documentation, integrated with your helpdesk, and designed to handle the repetitive questions that eat up your team's time.

Most support bot implementations I see are glorified FAQ search bars. They match keywords, return a help article link, and call it a day. I build systems that understand the question, pull the right answer from your knowledge base, and respond in natural language — or classify the ticket, assign priority, and route it to the right agent with full context if the AI can't handle it.

As CTO of a construction enterprise and founder of PrettyFly.ai, I build AI automation for real operational environments. I've integrated support bots with Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, and HubSpot across businesses handling hundreds of tickets daily.

## Service Description

Your support team answers the same questions hundreds of times a month. Password resets, order status, billing inquiries, how-to questions — they're important to the customer but they don't need a human. An AI support bot resolves these tickets instantly, 24/7, so your agents focus on complex issues that actually require judgment.

I build support bots that go beyond simple auto-replies. The AI is trained on your help center, product docs, and historical ticket data using retrieval-augmented generation — so it answers from your actual content, not from generic LLM knowledge. When a ticket comes in, the system classifies it by category and urgency, routes it to the right team if it needs a human, or resolves it directly with a grounded response.

The full system includes multi-channel deployment (website chat, email, Slack, WhatsApp), sentiment detection that flags frustrated customers for priority handling, a context panel that gives agents order history and account details on escalation, and an analytics dashboard tracking resolution rates, response times, and bot accuracy. Everything integrates with your existing helpdesk — Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, HubSpot, or whatever you're running.

Most of my clients see 40-60% of their ticket volume handled by the bot within the first month, with that number climbing as we refine the knowledge base.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You're getting [X tickets/month] and your team is spending too much time on [COMMON QUESTION TYPE] instead of [HIGH-VALUE WORK]. I build AI support systems that handle the repetitive stuff so your agents focus on what matters.

### Credibility
I deployed an AI support bot for a SaaS company that resolved 55% of incoming tickets without human intervention in the first 30 days. Average first-response time dropped from 3 hours to under 30 seconds, and their CSAT score went up because customers got instant answers instead of waiting in a queue.

### Approach
- Audit your current support channels, ticket categories, helpdesk setup, and resolution workflows (Day 1-3)
- Build the AI bot trained on your knowledge base with ticket classification and routing logic (Week 1)
- Integrate with your helpdesk, deploy across channels, and configure escalation workflows (Week 2)
- Test with live tickets, tune auto-reply accuracy, calibrate routing rules, and deliver analytics dashboard (Week 2-3)

### Differentiator
I don't build bots that frustrate your customers with bad answers and dead-end loops. My bots use RAG for accurate responses, escalate gracefully with full context, and include sentiment detection so angry customers get routed to humans immediately.

### CTA
I'd like to look at your current helpdesk data and ticket categories to scope this properly. Can we do a 15-minute call this week? I'll come back with a specific plan and projected resolution rates.
