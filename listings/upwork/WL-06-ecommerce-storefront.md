# E-Commerce Storefront Setup — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
E-Commerce Storefront | Shopify | Stripe | Custom Online Store

### Overview
I build e-commerce storefronts that load fast, look professional, and convert visitors into buyers. Whether you need a Shopify store for its ecosystem or a custom Next.js + Stripe build for maximum performance and control, I deliver a store that is ready to take orders from day one.

Most online stores fail at the basics: they load slowly on mobile (where 60%+ of traffic comes from), the checkout is clunky, there are no trust signals, and the product pages do not answer the questions buyers have before clicking "Add to Cart." I build stores that get these fundamentals right — sub-2-second load times, mobile-first design, streamlined checkout, and conversion elements that are proven to increase purchase rates.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise, my primary expertise is in business software and AI, but I bring the same performance-first engineering approach to e-commerce. I have built storefronts for product businesses that need speed, reliability, and proper analytics — not just a template with a logo swap.

## Service Description

An e-commerce store is a sales machine. Every design decision, every page load speed, every checkout step directly impacts whether a visitor becomes a buyer. I build stores with this engineering mindset: performance metrics first, then aesthetics on top.

For Shopify builds, I set up and customize your store with proper theme configuration, product organization, payment processing, shipping rules, and marketing integrations. I go beyond the defaults — configuring abandoned cart recovery, setting up proper analytics (GA4 + Facebook Pixel with correct e-commerce event tracking), and optimizing page speed by removing unnecessary apps and bloated theme code.

For custom builds (Next.js + Stripe), I deliver a headless e-commerce experience with maximum performance — server-side rendering, optimized images, minimal JavaScript, and a custom checkout flow. No monthly platform fees, no per-transaction surcharges beyond Stripe's standard rate, and complete control over every pixel and interaction.

Every store I build includes: mobile-responsive design verified on real devices, payment processing tested with real transactions, analytics tracking verified with real events, and a management interface so you can handle products and orders without touching code.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You need an online store for [PRODUCT TYPE] that [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT — fast launch, custom design, migration from existing platform]. I build e-commerce stores on [SHOPIFY/CUSTOM] and can have you taking orders within [TIMELINE].

### Credibility
I built a custom e-commerce storefront for a product brand that loads in 1.4 seconds on mobile, processes payments via Stripe, and integrates with their inventory and fulfillment systems — launched in 2 weeks and processing orders from day one.

### Approach
- Review product catalog, brand assets, and requirements; recommend platform and layout (Day 1-2)
- Build storefront, configure products, categories, and variants (Day 3-6)
- Set up payments, shipping, tax configuration, and checkout flow (Day 7-8)
- Configure analytics, email capture, and marketing integrations (Day 9-10)
- Test checkout end-to-end, connect domain, launch (Day 11-14)

### Differentiator
I approach e-commerce as engineering, not just design. Every store I build is tested for page speed (under 2 seconds), mobile usability (verified on real devices), and analytics accuracy (verified with real events). The result is a store that not only looks good but actually converts.
