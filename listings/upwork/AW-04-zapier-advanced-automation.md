# Zapier Advanced Automation — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Headline
Zapier Automation | Multi-Step Zaps | No-Code Workflows

### Overview
I build advanced Zapier automations that go beyond basic trigger-action pairs. Multi-step zaps with conditional paths, data transformations, webhooks, error handling, and cross-zap dependencies — the kind of Zapier work that actually replaces manual processes instead of just notifying you about them.

Most Zapier setups I inherit are underbuilt. Single-step zaps with no error handling, no filters, no formatting. They break on the first unexpected input and nobody knows until the data is already wrong. I build Zapier automations the way they should be built: with proper conditional logic, data validation, failure alerting, and documentation so your team can maintain them.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and a CTO with 10+ years in automation, I work across Zapier, n8n, and Make daily. I'll recommend the right tool for your use case — and if Zapier is it, I'll build something that handles real-world complexity, not just the happy path.

## Service Description

Your team is spending hours every week on manual data transfer, copy-pasting between apps, and chasing down records that should have synced automatically. Zapier can fix most of this — but only if it's set up correctly. The difference between a fragile single-step zap and a production-grade automation system is filters, paths, formatters, error handling, and proper testing.

I build Zapier automations that handle the complexity your business actually throws at them. Conditional paths that route data differently based on values. Formatter steps that clean and transform data before it reaches the destination. Webhook triggers for real-time processing. Error handling that alerts you on failure instead of silently dropping data.

I also know when Zapier isn't the right tool. If your automation needs self-hosted infrastructure, high-volume processing without per-task fees, or custom code-level API work, I'll tell you and recommend the better fit. I build on n8n and Make as well, so I have no platform loyalty — just a preference for whatever actually solves your problem.

Every project starts with a clear scope, includes testing against your real data, and ends with documentation your team can follow.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You need [PROCESS DESCRIPTION] automated so your team stops spending [TIME ESTIMATE] per week on it manually. I build these exact Zapier workflows every week and can scope this quickly.

### Credibility
I recently built a 7-zap automation system for an e-commerce client that eliminated 12 hours of weekly manual order processing — running for 4 months with a 99.5% success rate across 2,000+ monthly tasks.

### Approach
- Map your current manual process and identify every trigger, condition, and destination (Day 1)
- Build multi-step zaps with filters, formatters, paths, and error handling (Day 2-4)
- Test with your live data including edge cases — missing fields, duplicates, unexpected values (Day 5)
- Deploy, verify in production, and hand off with full documentation and a walkthrough (Day 6-7)

### Differentiator
I don't build toy zaps. Every automation includes conditional logic, data validation, and error alerting so it handles real-world data — not just clean test inputs. I also build on n8n and Make, so if Zapier isn't the right tool for your volume or complexity, I'll tell you before you waste money on the wrong platform.

### CTA
I can review your current setup and give you a detailed scope by tomorrow. Want to share which apps are involved and what manual process you want eliminated?
