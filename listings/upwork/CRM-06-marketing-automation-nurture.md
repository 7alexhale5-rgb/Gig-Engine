# Marketing Automation & Nurture Flows — Upwork Listing

## Specialized Profile Section

### Overview
I build marketing automation systems that nurture leads through your sales funnel automatically — the right message, at the right time, based on what each lead actually does. Email sequences, SMS follow-ups, lead scoring, lifecycle stage transitions, and the conditional logic that makes it all work.

Most businesses have leads falling through the cracks. Someone fills out a form, gets one follow-up email, and then nothing. The lead is not dead — they are just not ready yet. A proper nurture flow keeps your business top of mind with valuable content until they are ready to buy, then hands them off to sales at exactly the right moment. Without automation, this is impossible at scale.

As the founder of PrettyFly.ai and CTO of a construction enterprise, I build marketing automation for businesses with long sales cycles where nurturing is not optional. I work across GoHighLevel, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp, and Salesforce, handling the technical architecture: triggers, conditional branches, scoring, channel coordination, and CRM integration.

## Service Description

Marketing automation connects your lead generation to your sales pipeline with automated workflows that follow up, nurture, qualify, and route leads without manual effort. The difference between a system that converts and one that gets ignored is in the logic layer.

I build conditional workflows — if a lead opens email 3 but does not click, they get a different follow-up than someone who clicked and visited your pricing page. I configure channel escalation — if email engagement drops after touchpoint 4, the sequence switches to SMS. I set up lead scoring that tags and routes prospects based on cumulative engagement, so your sales team only gets notified when someone is actually warm.

Every automation project starts with journey mapping: how do leads come in, what do they care about at each stage, where do they typically stall, and what motivates them to buy? The workflow logic is designed around your actual buyer journey, not a generic template. I test every branch with real scenarios before going live and include monitoring so you can see which sequences are performing and where leads are dropping off.

## Sample Proposal

> **Usage**: Copy and replace all [BRACKETED] text with details from the specific job posting.

### Hook
You need automated nurture flows in [CRM PLATFORM] that follow up with [LEAD SOURCE] leads and move them through to [CONVERSION ACTION]. I build these systems every week and can have yours running within [TIMELINE].

### Credibility
I built a multi-channel nurture system for a B2B services company that increased their MQL-to-SQL conversion rate by 34% — a 12-touchpoint email + SMS sequence running on GoHighLevel with conditional branching and lead scoring, processing 500+ new leads per month on autopilot.

### Approach
- Map your customer journey: lead sources, stages, stall points, and conversion triggers (Day 1-2)
- Design automation flows with conditional logic, timing, and content briefs (Day 3-4)
- Build workflows in [CRM PLATFORM], configure triggers, scoring, and channel logic (Day 5-8)
- Test every branch, verify deliverability, confirm CRM integration (Day 9-10)
- Launch with monitoring, hand off documentation and flow diagrams (Day 11-12)

### Differentiator
I do not build simple timed drips. Every automation I deliver has conditional logic — different paths based on opens, clicks, replies, and inactivity. I set up lead scoring and channel escalation so your hottest leads get flagged and your cold leads get re-engaged automatically.
