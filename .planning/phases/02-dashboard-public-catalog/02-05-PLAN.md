<objective>
Human verification of all Phase 2 success criteria: service CRUD, profile management, public catalog with pillar grouping, mobile responsiveness, and pricing tier display.

Purpose: Phase 2 has 5 success criteria that must all be verified before marking the phase complete. This checkpoint covers end-to-end testing of the full dashboard and public catalog.

Output: Human confirmation that all criteria pass, or specific issues for gap closure.

  <name>Task 1: Verify all Phase 2 success criteria</name>
  <action>
Complete Phase 2: Dashboard with service CRUD, profile management, settings, and public catalog page.
  </action>
  <verify>
**Pre-requisites:**
- Ensure migration 018 has been applied to the Supabase project (via SQL editor or `supabase db push`)
- Ensure `npm run dev` is running at http://localhost:3000

**Success Criterion 1: Service CRUD**
1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Navigate to Services (should be default view)
3. If no services: verify onboarding checklist appears (Complete profile, Add first service, Share catalog link)
4. Click "Add your first service" or the "New Service" button
5. Create a service with: title, description (use some **markdown** formatting), select a pillar, set a Basic price, paste a thumbnail URL (e.g., https://picsum.photos/1280/769)
6. Save -- verify the service appears in the card grid
7. Click edit on the service -- verify all fields are pre-filled
8. Change the title and save -- verify the update is reflected
9. Delete the service with confirmation dialog -- verify it disappears

**Success Criterion 2: Profile management**
1. Navigate to Profile
2. Set display name, tagline, bio (use some markdown), and avatar URL
3. Save -- verify "Profile updated" confirmation
4. Refresh page -- verify fields retained saved values
5. Note the public catalog link shown on the page

**Success Criterion 3: Public catalog**
1. Open the catalog link from Step 2.5 in an incognito/private browser window (no login session)
2. Verify: catalog header shows avatar, display name, tagline, and bio
3. Verify: services are grouped under pillar section headings with colored accents
4. Verify: service cards show thumbnail images and markdown-rendered descriptions

**Success Criterion 4: Mobile responsiveness**
1. In the incognito window, open DevTools and set viewport to 375px width (iPhone SE)
2. Verify: no horizontal scrollbar appears
3. Verify: all touch targets are at least 44px
4. Verify: pricing tiers stack vertically on mobile
5. Verify: text is readable without zooming

**Success Criterion 5: Pricing tiers**
1. Back in the dashboard (logged-in window), create a service with Basic ($50), Standard ($100), and Premium ($200) pricing
2. Also create a service with "Contact for pricing" toggled on
3. View both services on the public catalog
4. Verify: multi-tier service shows all three tiers with prices
5. Verify: contact-for-pricing service shows "Contact for pricing" instead of a price
